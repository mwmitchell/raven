         <h3>A BALLAD OF LIFE</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">I found</span> in dreams a place
         of wind and flowers,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Full of sweet trees and colour
         of glad grass,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         In midst whereof there was
         <br>
         
         A lady clothed like summer with sweet hours.
         
         <br>
         
         Her beauty, fervent as a fiery moon,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Made my blood burn and
         swoon
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Like a flame rained upon.
         
         <br>
         
         Sorrow had filled her shaken eyelids'
         blue,
         <br>
         
         And her mouth's sad red heavy
         rose all through
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Seemed sad with glad things gone.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         She held a little cithern by the
         strings,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Shaped heartwise, strung with
         subtle-coloured hair
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Of some dead lute-player
         <br>
         
         That in dead years had done delicious
         things.
         
         <br>
         
         <center>2<br></center>
         
         The seven strings were named
         accordingly;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         The first string charity,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         The second tenderness,
         <br>
         
         The rest were pleasure, sorrow,
         sleep, and sin,
         <br>
         
         And loving-kindness, that is
         pity's kin
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         And is most pitiless.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         There were three men with her, each
         garmented
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         With gold and shod with gold
         upon the feet;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And with plucked ears of
         wheat
         <br>
         
         The first man's hair was wound
         upon his head.
         <br>
         
         His face was red, and his mouth
         curled and sad;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         All his gold raiment had
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Pale stains of dust and rust.
         
         <br>
         
         A riven hood was pulled across his eyes;
         <br>
         
         The token of him being upon
         this wise
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Made for a sign of Lust.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         The next was Shame, with hollow heavy
         face
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Coloured like green wood when flame kindles
         it.
         
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         He hath such feeble feet
         <br>
         
         They may not well endure in any place.
         
         <br>
         
         His face was full of grey old miseries,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And all his blood's
         increase
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Was even increase of pain.
         <br>
         
         The last was Fear, that is akin to
         Death;
         <br>
         
         He is Shame's friend, and
         always as Shame saith
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Fear answers him again.
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>3<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         My soul said in me; This is marvellous,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Seeing the air's face is not so
         delicate
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Nor the sun's grace so
         great,
         <br>
         
         If sin and she be kin or amorous.
         
         <br>
         
         And seeing where maidens served her on their
         knees,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         I bade one crave of these
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         To know the cause thereof.
         
         <br>
         
         Then Fear said: I am Pity that was dead.
         <br>
         
         And Shame said: I am Sorrow comforted.
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         And Lust said: I am Love.
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Thereat her hands began a lute-playing,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And her sweet mouth a song in a
         strange tongue;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And all the while she sung
         <br>
         
         There was no sound but long
         tears following
         <br>
         
         Long tears upon men's faces
         waxen white
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         With extreme sad delight.
         
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         But those three following men
         <br>
         
         Became as men raised up among
         the dead;
         <br>
         
         Great glad mouths open and fair
         cheeks made red
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         With child's blood come again.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Then I said: Now assuredly I see
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         My lady is perfect, and
         transfigureth
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         All sin and sorrow and
         death,
         <br>
         
         Making them fair as her own
         eyelids be,
         <br>
         
         Or lips wherein my whole soul's
         life abides;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Or as her sweet white sides
         <br>
         
         <center>4<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         And bosom carved to kiss.
         
         <br>
         
         Now therefore, if her pity further me,
         <br>
         
         Doubtless for her sake all my
         days shall be
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         As righteous as she is.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Forth, ballad, and take roses in both
         arms,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Even till the top rose touch
         thee in the throat
         <br>
         
         Where the least thornprick
         harms;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And girdled in thy golden
         singing-coat,
         <br>
         
         Come thou before my lady and
         say this;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Borgia, thy gold hair's colour
         burns in me,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Thy mouth makes beat my blood
         in feverish rhymes;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Therefore so many as these
         roses be,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Kiss me so many times.
         
         <br>
         
         Then it may be, seeing how sweet she is,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         That she will stoop herself
         none otherwise
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Than a blown vine-branch
         doth,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And kiss thee with soft
         laughter on thine eyes,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Ballad, and on thy mouth.

         <h3>A BALLAD OF DEATH</h3>

         Girdle thyself with sighing for
         a girth
         <br>
         
         Upon the sides of mirth,
         <br>
         
         Cover thy lips and eyelids, let
         thine ears
         <br>
         
         Be filled with rumour of people
         sorrowing;
         <br>
         
         Make thee soft raiment out of
         woven sighs
         <br>
         
         Upon the flesh to cleave,
         <br>
         
         Set pains therein and many a
         grievous thing,
         <br>
         
         And many sorrows after each his
         wise
         <br>
         
         For armlet and for gorget and for sleeve.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         O Love's lute heard about the lands of
         death,
         <br>
         
         Left hanged upon the trees that
         were therein;
         <br>
         
         O Love and Time and Sin,
         <br>
         
         Three singing mouths that mourn
         now underbreath,
         <br>
         
         Three lovers, each one evil
         spoken of;
         <br>
         
         O smitten lips wherethrough
         this voice of mine
         <br>
         
         Came softer with her
         praise;
         <br>
         
         Abide a little for our lady's love.
         
         <br>
         
         The kisses of her mouth were more than
         wine,
         <br>
         
         And more than peace the passage of her days.
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>6<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         O Love, thou knowest if she were good to see.
         <br>
         
         O Time, thou shalt not find in any land
         <br>
         
         Till, cast out of thine
         hand,
         <br>
         
         The sunlight and the moonlight
         fail from thee,
         <br>
         
         Another woman fashioned like as this.
         
         <br>
         
         O Sin, thou knowest that all thy shame in
         her
         <br>
         
         Was made a goodly thing;
         <br>
         
         Yea, she caught Shame and
         shamed him with her kiss,
         <br>
         
         With her fair kiss, and lips
         much lovelier
         <br>
         
         Than lips of amorous roses in late spring.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         By night there stood over against my bed
         <br>
         
         Queen Venus with a hood striped
         gold and black,
         <br>
         
         Both sides drawn fully back
         <br>
         
         From brows wherein the sad
         blood failed of red,
         <br>
         
         And temples drained of purple and full of
         death.
         
         <br>
         
         Her curled hair had the wave of
         sea-water
         <br>
         
         And the sea's gold in it.
         
         <br>
         
         Her eyes were as a dove's that sickeneth.
         <br>
         
         Strewn dust of gold she had shed over
         her,
         <br>
         
         And pearl and purple and amber on her feet.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Upon her raiment of dyed sendaline
         <br>
         
         Were painted all the secret
         ways of love
         <br>
         
         And covered things thereof,
         <br>
         
         That hold delight as
         grape-flowers hold their wine;
         <br>
         
         Red mouths of maidens and red
         feet of doves,
         <br>
         
         And brides that kept within the
         bride-chamber
         <br>
         
         <center>7<br></center>
         
         Their garment of soft
         shame,
         <br>
         
         And weeping faces of the
         wearied loves
         <br>
         
         That swoon in sleep and awake
         wearier,
         <br>
         
         With heat of lips and hair shed out like
         flame.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         The tears that through her eyelids fell on
         me
         <br>
         
         Made mine own bitter where they
         ran between
         <br>
         
         As blood had fallen
         therein,
         <br>
         
         She saying; Arise, lift up
         thine eyes and see
         <br>
         
         If any glad thing be or any
         good
         <br>
         
         Now the best thing is taken
         forth of us;
         <br>
         
         Even she to whom all praise
         <br>
         
         Was as one flower in a great
         multitude,
         <br>
         
         One glorious flower of many and
         glorious,
         <br>
         
         One day found gracious among
         many days:
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Even she whose handmaiden was
         Loveâto whom
         <br>
         
         At kissing times across her
         stateliest bed
         <br>
         
         Kings bowed themselves and
         shed
         <br>
         
         Pale wine, and honey with the
         honeycomb,
         <br>
         
         And spikenard bruised for a
         burnt-offering;
         <br>
         
         Even she between whose lips the
         kiss became
         <br>
         
         As fire and frankincense;
         <br>
         
         Whose hair was as gold raiment
         on a king,
         <br>
         
         Whose eyes were as the morning
         purged with flame,
         <br>
         
         Whose eyelids as sweet savour issuing
         thence.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Then I beheld, and lo on the other side
         <br>
         
         My lady's likeness crowned and robed and
         dead.
         
         <br>
         
         <center>8<br></center>
         
         Sweet still, but now not red,
         <br>               
         
         Was the shut mouth whereby men lived and
         died.
         
         <br>
         
         And sweet, but emptied of the blood's blue
         shade,
         <br>
         
         The great curled eyelids that withheld her
         eyes.
         
         <br>
         
         And sweet, but like spoilt gold,
         <br>
         
         The weight of colour in her tresses weighed.
         
         <br>
         
         And sweet, but as a vesture with new
         dyes,
         <br>
         
         The body that was clothed with love of old.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Ah! that my tears filled all her woven
         hair
         <br>
         
         And all the hollow bosom of her
         gownâ
         <br>
         
         Ah! that my tears ran down
         <br>
         
         Even to the place where many
         kisses were,
         <br>
         
         Even where her parted
         breast-flowers have place,
         <br>
         
         Even where they are cloven apartâwho knows
         not this?
         
         <br>
         
         Ah! the flowers cleave apart
         <br>
         
         And their sweet fills the
         tender interspace;
         <br>
         
         Ah! the leaves grown thereof
         were things to kiss
         <br>
         
         Ere their fine gold was tarnished at the
         heart.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Ah! in the days when God did good to me,
         <br>
         
         Each part about her was a
         righteous thing;
         <br>
         
         Her mouth an almsgiving,
         <br>
         
         The glory of her garments
         charity,
         <br>
         
         The beauty of her bosom a good
         deed,
         <br>
         
         In the good days when God kept
         sight of us;
         <br>
         
         Love lay upon her eyes,
         <br>
         
         And on that hair whereof the
         world takes heed;
         <br>
         
         <center>9<br></center>                
         
         And all her body was more
         virtuous
         <br>                
         
         Than souls of women fashioned otherwise.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Now, ballad, gather poppies in thine
         hands
         <br>
         
          And sheaves of brier and many
         rusted sheaves
         <br>
         
         Rain-rotten in rank lands,
         <br>
         
         Waste marigold and late unhappy
         leaves
         <br>
         
         And grass that fades ere any of
         it be mown;
         <br>
         
         And when thy bosom is filled
         full thereof
         <br>
         
         Seek out Death's face ere the
         light altereth,
         <br>
         
         And say "My master that was
         thrall to Love
         <br>
         
         Is become thrall to Death."
         
         <br>
         
         Bow down before him, ballad, sigh and
         groan,
         <br>
         
         But make no sojourn in thy
         outgoing;
         <br>
         
         For haply it may be
         <br>
         
         That when thy feet return at
         evening
         <br>
         
         Death shall come in with thee.

         Lors dit en plourant; HÃ©las trop
         malheureux homme et mauldict pescheur, oncques ne verrai-je
         clÃ©mence et misÃ©ricorde de Dieu.
         Ores m'en irai-je d'icy et me
         cacherai dedans le mont Horsel, en requÃ©rant de faveur et
         d'amoureuse merci ma doulce dame VÃ©nus, car pour son amour
         serai-je bien Ã  tout jamais damnÃ© en enfer.
         Voicy la fin de tous mes faicts
         d'armes et de toutes mes belles chansons.
         HÃ©las, trop belle estoyt la face
         de ma dame et ses yeulx, et en mauvais jour je vis ces
         chouses-lÃ .
         Lors s'en alla tout en gÃ©missant
         et se retourna chez elle, et lÃ  vescut tristement en grand amour
         prÃ¨s de sa dame.
         Puis aprÃ¨s advint que le pape
         vit un jour esclater sur son baston force belles fleurs rouges
         et blanches et maints boutons de feuilles, et ainsi vit-il
         reverdir toute l'escorce.
         Ce dont il eut grande crainte et
         moult s'en esmut, et grande pitiÃ© lui prit de ce chevalier qui
         s'en estoyt dÃ©parti sans espoir comme un homme misÃ©rable et
         damnÃ©.
         Doncques envoya force messaigers
         devers luy pour le ramener, disant qu'il aurait de Dieu grace et
         bonne absolution de son grand pÃ©chÃ© d'amour.
         Mais oncques plus ne le virent;
         car toujours demeura ce pauvre chevalier auprÃ¨s de VÃ©nus la
         haulte et forte dÃ©esse Ã¨s flancs de la montagne amoureuse.

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Asleep</span> or waking is it? for her neck,
         <br>
         
         Kissed over close, wears yet a purple speck
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Wherein the pained blood falters and goes out;

         Soft, and stung
         softlyâfairer for a fleck.

         There is no vein at work upon her face;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Her eyelids are so peaceable, no doubt

         Deep sleep has
         warmed her blood through all its ways.

         <br><br>
         
         Lo, this is she
         that was the world's delight;
         <br>
         
         The old grey years were parcels of her might;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         The strewings of the ways wherein she trod

         Were the twain
         seasons of the day and night.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Lo, she was thus
         when her clear limbs enticed
         <br>
         
         All lips that now grow sad with kissing
         Christ,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Stained with blood fallen from the feet of
         God,
         <br>
         
         The feet and hands
         whereat our souls were priced.
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>14<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         Alas, Lord, surely thou art great and
         fair.
         <br>
         
         
         But lo her wonderfully woven hair!
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And thou didst
         heal us with thy piteous kiss;
         <br>
         
         But see now, Lord;
         her mouth is lovelier.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         She is right fair; what hath she done to
         thee?
         <br>
         
         Nay, fair Lord
         Christ, lift up thine eyes and see;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Had now thy mother
         such a lipâlike this?
         
         <br>
         
         Thou knowest how sweet a thing it is to
         me.
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Inside the Horsel
         here the air is hot;
         <br>
         
         Right little peace one hath for it, God wot;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         The scented dusty daylight burns the air,
         <br>
         
         And my heart
         chokes me till I hear it not.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Behold, my Venus,
         my soul's body, lies
         <br>
         
         With my love laid upon her garment-wise,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Feeling my love in all her limbs and hair
         <br>
         
         And shed between
         her eyelids through her eyes.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         She holds my heart
         in her sweet open hands
         <br>
         
         Hanging asleep; hard by her head there stands,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Crowned with gilt thorns and clothed with flesh
         like fire,
         <br>
         
         Love, wan as foam blown up the salt burnt sandsâ
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Hot as the brackish waifs of yellow spume
         <br>
         
         That shift and steamâloose clots of arid
         fume
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         From the sea's panting mouth of dry desire;
         <br>
         
         There stands he,
         like one labouring at a loom.
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>15<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         The warp holds
         fast across; and every thread
         <br>
         
         That makes the woof up has dry specks of red;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Always the shuttle cleaves clean through, and
         he
         <br>
         
         Weaves with the
         hair of many a ruined head.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Love is not glad
         nor sorry, as I deem;
         <br>
         
         Labouring he dreams, and labours in the dream,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Till when the spool is finished, lo I see
         <br>
         
         His web, reeled
         off, curls and goes out like steam.
         
         <br>
                 
         <br><br>
         
         Night falls like
         fire; the heavy lights run low,
         <br>
         
         And as they drop, my blood and body so
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Shake as the flame shakes, full of days and
         hours
         <br>
         
         That sleep not
         neither weep they as they go.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Ah yet would God
         this flesh of mine might be
         <br>
         
         Where air might wash and long leaves cover me,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Where tides of grass break into foam of
         flowers,
         <br>
         
         Or where the
         wind's feet shine along the sea.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Ah yet would God
         that stems and roots were bred
         <br>
         
         Out of my weary body and my head,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         That sleep were sealed upon me with a seal,
         <br>
         
         And I were as the
         least of all his dead.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Would God my blood
         were dew to feed the grass,
         <br>
         
         Mine ears made deaf and mine eyes blind as
         glass,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         My body broken as a turning wheel,
         <br>
         
         And my mouth
         stricken ere it saith Alas!
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>16<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         Ah God, that love
         were as a flower or flame,
         <br>
         
         That life were as the naming of a name,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         That death were not more pitiful than desire,
         <br>
         
         That these things
         were not one thing and the same!
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Behold now, surely
         somewhere there is death:
         <br>
         
         For each man hath some space of years, he
         saith,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         A little space of time ere time expire,
         <br>
         
         A little day, a
         little way of breath.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         And lo, between
         the sundawn and the sun,
         <br>
         
         His day's work and his night's work are
         undone;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And lo, between the nightfall and the night,
         <br>
         
         He is not, and
         none knoweth of such an one.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Ah God, that I
         were as all souls that be,
         <br>
         
         As any herb or leaf of any tree,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         As men that toil through hours of labouring
         light,
         <br>
         
         As bones of men
         under the deep sharp sea.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Outside it must be
         winter among men;
         <br>
         
         For at the gold bars of the gates again
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         I heard all night and all the hours of it
         <br>
         
         The wind's wet
         wings and fingers drip with rain.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Knights gather,
         riding sharp for cold; I know
         <br>
         
         The ways and woods are strangled with the
         snow;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And with short song the maidens spin and sit
         <br>
         
         Until Christ's
         birthnight, lily-like, arow.
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>17<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         The scent and
         shadow shed about me make
         <br>
         
         The very soul in all my senses ache;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         The hot hard night is fed upon my breath,
         <br>
         
         And sleep beholds me from afar awake.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Alas, but surely
         where the hills grow deep,
         <br>
         
         Or where the wild ways of the sea are steep,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Or in strange places somewhere there is death,
         <br>
         
         And on death's
         face the scattered hair of sleep.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         There lover-like
         with lips and limbs that meet
         <br>
         
         They lie, they pluck sweet fruit of life and eat;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         But me the hot and hungry days devour,
         <br>
         
         And in my mouth no
         fruit of theirs is sweet.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         No fruit of
         theirs, but fruit of my desire,
         <br>
         
         For her love's sake whose lips through mine respire;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Her eyelids on her eyes like flower on flower,
         <br>
         
         Mine eyelids on
         mine eyes like fire on fire.
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>15<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         So lie we, not as
         sleep that lies by death,
         <br>
         
         With heavy kisses and with happy breath;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Not as man lies by woman, when the bride
         <br>
         
         Laughs low for
         love's sake and the word's he saith.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         For she lies,
         laughing low with love; she lies,
         <br>
         
         And turns his kisses on her lips to sighs,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         To sighing sound of lips unsatisfied,
         <br>
         
         And the sweet
         tears are tender with her eyes.
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>18<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         Ah, not as they,
         but as the souls that were
         <br>
         
         Slain in the old time, having found her fair;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Who, sleeping with her lips upon their eyes,
         <br>
         
         Heard sudden
         serpents hiss across her hair.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Their blood runs
         round the roots of time like rain;
         <br>
         
         She casts them forth and gathers them again;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         With nerve and bone she weaves and multiplies
         <br>
         
         Exceeding pleasure
         out of extreme pain.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Her little
         chambers drip with flower-like red,
         <br>
         
         Her girdles, and the chaplets of her head,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Her armlets and her anklets; with her feet
         <br>
         
         She tramples all
         that winepress of the dead.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Her gateways smoke
         with fume of flowers and fires,
         <br>
         
         With loves burnt out and unassuaged desires;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Between her lips the steam of them is sweet,
         <br>
         
         The languor in her ears of many lyres.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Her beds are full
         of perfume and sad sound,
         <br>
         
         Her doors are made with music, and barred round
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         With sighing and with laughter and with tears,
         <br>
         
         With tears whereby
         strong souls of men are bound.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         There is the knight Adonis that was slain; <br>
         With flesh and blood she chains him for a chain; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The body and the spirit in her ears <br>
         Cry, for her lips divide him vein by vein.<br>
         
         
         <center>19<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Yea, all she slayeth; yea, every man save me; <br>
         Me, love, thy lover that must cleave to thee <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till the ending of the days and ways of earth, <br>
         The shaking of the sources of the sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Me, most forsaken of all souls that fell; <br>
         Me, satiated with things insatiable; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Me, for whose sake the extreme hell makes mirth, <br>
         Yea, laughter kindles at the heart of hell.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Alas thy beauty! for thy mouth's sweet sake <br>
         My soul is bitter to me, my limbs quake <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As water, as the flesh of men that weep, <br>
         As their heart's vein whose heart goes nigh to break.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah God, that sleep with flower-sweet finger-tips <br>
         Would crush the fruit of death upon my lips; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ah God, that death would tread the grapes of sleep <br>
         And wring their juice upon me as it drips.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There is no change of cheer for many days, <br>
         But change of chimes high up in the air, that sways <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Rung by the running fingers of the wind; <br>
         And singing sorrows heard on hidden ways.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Day smiteth day in twain, night sundereth night, <br>
         And on mine eyes the dark sits as the light; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yea, Lord, thou knowest I know not, having sinned, <br>
         If heaven be clean or unclean in thy sight.<br>
         
         
         <center>20<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Yea, as if earth were sprinkled over me, <br>
         Such chafed harsh earth as chokes a sandy sea, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Each pore doth yearn, and the dried blood thereof <br>
         Gasps by sick fits, my heart swims heavily,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There is a feverish famine in my veins; <br>
         Below her bosom, where a crushed grape stains <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The white and blue, there my lips caught and clove <br>
         An hour since, and what mark of me remains?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I dare not always touch her, lest the kiss <br>
         Leave my lips charred. Yea, Lord, a little bliss, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Brief bitter bliss, one hath for a great sin; <br>
         Nathless thou knowest how sweet a thing it is.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Sin, is it sin whereby men's souls are thrust <br>
         Into the pit? yet had I a good trust <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To save my soul before it slipped therein, <br>
         Trod under by the fire-shod feet of lust.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For if mine eyes fail and my soul takes breath, <br>
         I look between the iron sides of death <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Into sad hell where all sweet love hath end, <br>
         All but the pain that never finisheth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There are the naked faces of great kings, <br>
         The singing folk with all their lute-playings; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There when one cometh he shall have to friend <br>
         The grave that covets and the worm that clings.<br>
         
         
         <center>21<br></center>
         <br><br>
         There sit the knights that were so great of hand, <br>
         The ladies that were queens of fair green land, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Grown grey and black now, brought unto the dust, <br>
         Soiled, without raiment, clad about with sand.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There is one end for all of them; they sit <br>
         Naked and sad, they drink the dregs of it, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Trodden as grapes in the wine-press of lust, <br>
         Trampled and trodden by the fiery feet.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I see the marvellous mouth whereby there fell <br>
         Cities and people whom the gods loved well, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yet for her sake on them the fire gat hold, <br>
         And for their sakes on her the fire of hell.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And softer than the Egyptian lote-leaf is, <br>
         The queen whose face was worth the world to kiss, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wearing at breast a suckling snake of gold; <br>
         And large pale lips of strong Semiramis,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Curled like a tiger's that curl back to feed; <br>
         Red only where the last kiss made them bleed; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her hair most thick with many a carven gem, <br>
         Deep in the mane, great-chested, like a steed.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, with red sin the faces of them shine; <br>
         But in all these there was no sin like mine; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No, not in all the strange great sins of them <br>
         That made the wine-press froth and foam with wine.<br>
         
         
         <center>22<br></center>
         <br><br>
         For I was of Christ's choosing, I God's knight, <br>
         No blinkard heathen stumbling for scant light; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I can well see, for all the dusty days <br>
         Gone past, the clean great time of goodly fight.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I smell the breathing battle sharp with blows, <br>
         With shriek of shafts and snapping short of bows; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The fair pure sword smites out in subtle ways, <br>
         Sounds and long lights are shed between the rows<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Of beautiful mailed men; the edged light slips, <br>
         Most like a snake that takes short breath and dips <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sharp from the beautifully bending head, <br>
         With all its gracious body lithe as lips<br>
         
         <br><br>
         That curl in touching you; right in this wise <br>
         My sword doth, seeming fire in mine own eyes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Leaving all colours in them brown and red <br>
         And flecked with death; then the keen breaths like sighs,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The caught-up choked dry laughters following them, <br>
         When all the fighting face is grown a flame <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For pleasure, and the pulse that stuns the ears, <br>
         And the heart's gladness of the goodly game.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let me think yet a little; I do know <br>
         These things were sweet, but sweet such years ago, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Their savour is all turned now into tears; <br>
         Yea, ten years since, where the blue ripples blow,<br>
         
         
         <center>23<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The blue curled eddies of the blowing Rhine, <br>
         I felt the sharp wind shaking grass and vine <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Touch my blood too, and sting me with delight <br>
         Through all this waste and weary body of mine<br>
         
         <br><br>
         That never feels clear air; right gladly then <br>
         I rode alone, a great way off my men, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And heard the chiming bridle smite and smite, <br>
         And gave each rhyme thereof some rhyme again,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Till my song shifted to that iron one; <br>
         Seeing there rode up between me and the sun <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Some certain of my foe's men, for his three <br>
         White wolves across their painted coats did run.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The first red-bearded, with square cheeksâalack, <br>
         I made my knave's blood turn his beard to black; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The slaying of him was a joy to see: <br>
         Perchance too, when at night he came not back,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Some woman fell a-weeping, whom this thief <br>
         Would beat when he had drunken; yet small grief <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Hath any for the ridding of such knaves; <br>
         Yea, if one wept, I doubt her teen was brief.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         This bitter love is sorrow in all lands, <br>
         Draining of eyelids, wringing of drenched hands, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sighing of hearts and filling up of graves; <br>
         A sign across the head of the world he stands,<br>
         
         
         <center>24<br></center>
         <br><br>
         An one that hath a plague-mark on his brows; <br>
         Dust and spilt blood do track him to his house <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Down under earth; sweet smells of lip and cheek, <br>
         Like a sweet snake's breath made more poisonous<br>
         
         <br><br>
         With chewing of some perfumed deadly grass, <br>
         Are shed all round his passage if he pass, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And their quenched savour leaves the whole soul
         weak, <br>
         Sick with keen guessing whence the perfume was.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         As one who hidden in deep sedge and reeds <br>
         Smells the rare scent made where a panther feeds, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And tracking ever slotwise the warm smell <br>
         Is snapped upon by the sweet mouth and bleeds,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         His head far down the hot sweet throat of herâ<br>
         So one tracks love, whose breath is deadlier, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And lo, one springe and you are fast in hell, <br>
         Fast as the gin's grip of a wayfarer.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I think now, as the heavy hours decease <br>
         One after one, and bitter thoughts increase <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One upon one, of all sweet finished things; <br>
         The breaking of the battle; the long peace<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Wherein we sat clothed softly, each man's hair <br>
         Crowned with green leaves beneath white hoods of vair; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The sound of sharp spears at great tourneyings, <br>
         And noise of singing in the late sweet air.<br>
         
         
         <center>25<br></center>
         <br><br>
         I sang of love too, knowing nought thereof; <br>
         "Sweeter," I said, "the little laugh of love <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than tears out of the eyes of Magdalen, <br>
         Or any fallen feather of the Dove.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "The broken little laugh that spoils a kiss, <br>
         The ache of purple pulses, and the bliss <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of blinded eyelids that expand againâ<br>
         Love draws them open with those lips of his,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "Lips that cling hard till the kissed face has grown <br>
         Of one same fire and colour with their own; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then ere one sleep, appeased with sacrifice, <br>
         Where his lips wounded, there his lips atone."<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I sang these things long since and knew them not; <br>
         "Lo, here is love, or there is love, God wot, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This man and that finds favour in his eyes," <br>
         I said, "but I, what guerdon have I got?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "The dust of praise that is blown everywhere <br>
         In all men's faces with the common air; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The bay-leaf that wants chafing to be sweet <br>
         Before they wind it in a singer's hair."<br>
         
         <br><br>
         So that one dawn I rode forth sorrowing; <br>
         I had no hope but of some evil thing, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And so rode slowly past the windy wheat, <br>
         And past the vineyard and the water-spring,<br>
         
         
         <center>26<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Up to the Horsel. A great elder-tree <br>
         Held back its heaps of flowers to let me see <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The ripe tall grass, and one that walked therein, <br>
         Naked, with hair shed over to the knee.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She walked between the blossom and the grass; <br>
         I knew the beauty of her, what she was, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The beauty of her body and her sin, <br>
         And in my flesh the sin of hers, alas!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Alas! for sorrow is all the end of this. <br>
         O sad kissed mouth, how sorrowful it is! <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O breast whereat some suckling sorrow clings, <br>
         Red with the bitter blossom of a kiss!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah, with blind lips I felt for you, and found <br>
         About my neck your hands and hair enwound, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The hands that stifle and the hair that stings, <br>
         I felt them fasten sharply without sound.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, for my sin I had great store of bliss: <br>
         Rise up, make answer for me, let thy kiss <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Seal my lips hard from speaking of my sin, <br>
         Lest one go mad to hear how sweet it is.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yet I waxed faint with fume of barren bowers, <br>
         And murmuring of the heavy-headed hours; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And let the dove's beak fret and peck within <br>
         My lips in vain, and Love shed fruitless flowers.<br>
         
         
         <center>27<br></center>
         <br><br>
         So that God looked upon me when your hands <br>
         Were hot about me; yea, God brake my bands <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To save my soul alive, and I came forth <br>
         Like a man blind and naked in strange lands<br>
         
         <br><br>
         That hears men laugh and weep, and knows not whence <br>
         Nor wherefore, but is broken in his sense; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Howbeit I met folk riding from the north <br>
         Toward Rome, to purge them of their souls' offence,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And rode with them, and spake to none; the day <br>
         Stunned me like lights upon some wizard way, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And ate like fire mine eyes and mine eyesight; <br>
         So rode I, hearing all these chant and pray,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And marvelled; till before us rose and fell <br>
         White cursed hills, like outer skirts of hell <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Seen where men's eyes look through the day to night, <br>
         Like a jagged shell's lips, harsh, untunable,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Blown in between by devils' wrangling breath; <br>
         Nathless we won well past that hell and death, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Down to the sweet land where all airs are good, <br>
         Even unto Rome where God's grace tarrieth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then came each man and worshipped at his knees <br>
         Who in the Lord God's likeness bears the keys <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To bind or loose, and called on Christ's shed blood, <br>
         And so the sweet-souled father gave him ease.<br>
         
         
         <center>28<br></center>
         <br><br>
         But when I came I fell down at his feet, <br>
         Saying, "Father, though the Lord's blood be right sweet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The spot it takes not off the panther's skin, <br>
         Nor shall an Ethiop's stain be bleached with it.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "Lo, I have sinned and have spat out at God, <br>
         Wherefore his hand is heavier and his rod <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         More sharp because of mine exceeding sin, <br>
         And all his raiment redder than bright blood<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "Before mine eyes; yea, for my sake I wot <br>
         The heat of hell is waxen seven times hot <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Through my great sin." Then spake he some sweet
         word, <br>
         Giving me cheer; which thing availed me not;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, scarce I wist if such indeed were said; <br>
         For when I ceasedâlo, as one newly dead <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who hears a great cry out of hell, I heard <br>
         The crying of his voice across my head.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "Until this dry shred staff, that hath no whit <br>
         Of leaf nor bark, bear blossom and smell sweet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Seek thou not any mercy in God's sight, <br>
         For so long shalt thou be cast out from it."<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, what if dried-up stems wax red and green, <br>
         Shall that thing be which is not nor has been? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yea, what if sapless bark wax green and white, <br>
         Shall any good fruit grow upon my sin?<br>
         
         
         <center>29<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Nay, though sweet fruit were plucked of a dry tree, <br>
         And though men drew sweet waters of the sea, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There should not grow sweet leaves on this dead
         stem, <br>
         This waste wan body and shaken soul of me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, though God search it warily enough, <br>
         There is not one sound thing in all thereof; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though he search all my veins through, searching
         them <br>
         He shall find nothing whole therein but love.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For I came home right heavy, with small cheer, <br>
         And lo my love, mine own soul's heart, more dear <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than mine own soul, more beautiful than God, <br>
         Who hath my being between the hands of herâ <br>
         
         <br><br>
         Fair still, but fair for no man saving me, <br>
         As when she came out of the naked sea <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Making the foam as fire whereon she trod, <br>
         And as the inner flower of fire was she.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, she laid hold upon me, and her mouth <br>
         Clove unto mine as soul to body doth, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And, laughing, made her lips luxurious; <br>
         Her hair had smells of all the sunburnt south,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Strange spice and flower, strange savour of crushed fruit, <br>
         And perfume the swart kings tread underfoot <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For pleasure when their minds wax amorous, <br>
         Charred frankincense and grated sandal-root.<br>
         
         
         <center>30<br></center>
         <br><br>
         And I forgot fear and all weary things, <br>
         All ended prayers and perished thanksgivings, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Feeling her face with all her eager hair <br>
         Cleave to me, clinging as a fire that clings<br>
         
         <br><br>
         To the body and to the raiment, burning them; <br>
         As after death I know that such-like flame <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall cleave to me for ever; yea, what care, <br>
         Albeit I burn then, having felt the same?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah love, there is no better life than this; <br>
         To have known love, how bitter a thing it is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And afterward be cast out of God's sight; <br>
         Yea, these that know not, shall they have such bliss<br>
         
         <br><br>
         High up in barren heaven before his face <br>
         As we twain in the heavy-hearted place, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Remembering love and all the dead delight, <br>
         And all that time was sweet with for a space?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For till the thunder in the trumpet be, <br>
         Soul may divide from body, but not we <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One from another; I hold thee with my hand, <br>
         I let mine eyes have all their will of thee,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I seal myself upon thee with my might, <br>
         Abiding alway out of all men's sight <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Until God loosen over sea and land <br>
         The thunder of the trumpets of the night.<br>

         Nay, I will never loosen hold nor breathe <br>
         Till thou have slain me; godlike for great brows <br>
         Thou art, and thewed as gods are, with clear hair: <br>
         Draw now thy sword and smite me as thou art god, <br>

         Let me not starve between desire and death, <br>

         For in the vein-drawn ashen-coloured palm <br>
         Death's hollow hand holds water of sweet draught <br>
         To dip and slake dried mouths at, as a deer <br>
         Specked red from thorns laps deep and loses pain. <br>
         Yea, if mine own blood ran upon my mouth, <br>
         I would drink that. Nay, but be swift with me; <br>
         Set thy sword here between the girdle and breast, <br>
         For I shall grow a poison if I live. <br>
         Are not my cheeks as grass, my body pale, <br>

         O whatsoever of godlike names thou be, <br>
         By thy chief name I charge thee, thou strong god, <br>
         And bid thee slay me. Strike, up to the gold, <br>
         Up to the hand-grip of the hilt; strike here; <br>

         Man, what have I to do with shame or thee? <br>
         I am not of one counsel with the gods. <br>
         I am their kin, I have strange blood in me, <br>
         I am not of their likeness nor of thine: <br>
         My veins are mixed, and therefore am I mad, <br>
         Yea therefore chafe and turn on mine own flesh, <br>
         Half of a woman made with half a god. <br>
         But thou wast hewn out of an iron womb <br>
         And fed with molten mother-snow for milk. <br>
         A sword was nurse of thine; Hippolyta, <br>
         That had the spear to father, and the axe <br>
         To bridesman, and wet blood of sword-slain men <br>

         Nay, for I love thee, I will have thy hands, <br>
         Nay, for I will not loose thee, thou art sweet, <br>
         Thou art my son, I am thy father's wife, <br>
         I ache toward thee with a bridal blood, <br>
         The pulse is heavy in all my married veins, <br>
         My whole face beats, I will feed full of thee, <br>
         My body is empty of ease, I will be fed, <br>
         I am burnt to the bone with love, thou shalt not go, <br>
         I am heartsick, and mine eyelids prick mine eyes, <br>

         I do but bid thee be unmerciful, <br>
         Even the one thing thou art. Pity me not: <br>
         Thou wert not quick to pity. Think of me <br>
         As of a thing thy hounds are keen upon <br>
         In the wet woods between the windy ways, <br>
         And slay me for a spoil. This body of mine <br>
         Is worth a wild beast's fell or hide of hair, <br>

         I pray thee by thy cold green holy crown <br>

         Nay, but thou wilt not. Death is not like thee, <br>
         Albeit men hold him worst of all the gods. <br>
         For of all gods Death only loves not gifts,*
         <br>
         Nor with burnt-offering nor blood-sacrifice <br>
         Shalt thou do aught to get thee grace of him; <br>
         He will have naught of altar and altar-song, <br>
         And from him only of all the lords in heaven <br>
         Persuasion turns a sweet averted mouth.<br>
         But thou art worse: from thee with baffled breath <br>
         Back on my lips my prayer falls like a blow, <br>
         And beats upon them, dumb. What shall I say? <br>
         There is no word I can compel thee with <br>
         
         <center>36<br></center>
         To do me good and slay me. But take heed; <br>
         I say, be wary; look between thy feet, <br>
         Lest a snare take them though the ground be good.<br>

         O women, O sweet people of this land, <br>
         O goodly city and pleasant ways thereof, <br>
         And woods with pasturing grass and great well-heads, <br>
         And hills with light and night between your leaves, <br>
         And winds with sound and silence in your lips, <br>
         And earth and water and all immortal things, <br>
         I take you to my witness what I am. <br>
         There is a god about me like as fire, <br>
         Sprung whence, who knoweth, or who hath heart to say? <br>
         A god more strong than whom slain beasts can soothe, <br>
         Or honey, or any spilth of blood-like wine, <br>
         Nor shall one please him with a whitened brow <br>
         Nor wheat nor wool nor aught of plaited leaf. <br>
         For like my mother am I stung and slain, <br>
         And round my cheeks have such red malady <br>
         And on my lips such fire and foam as hers. <br>
         This is that Ate out of Amathus <br>
         That breeds up death and gives it one for love. <br>
         She hath slain mercy, and for dead mercy's sake <br>
         (Being frighted with this sister that was slain) <br>
         Flees from before her fearful-footed shame, <br>
         And will not bear the bending of her brows <br>
         And long soft arrows flown from under them <br>
         As from bows bent. Desire flows out of her <br>
         As out of lips doth speech: and over her <br>
         Shines fire, and round her and beneath her fire. <br>
         She hath sown pain and plague in all our house, <br>
         
         <center>38<br></center>
         Love loathed of love, and mates unmatchable, <br>
         Wild wedlock, and the lusts that bleat or low,<br>
         And marriage-fodder snuffed about of kine. <br>
         Lo how the heifer runs with leaping flank <br>
         Sleek under shaggy and speckled lies of hair, <br>
         And chews a horrible lip, and with harsh tongue <br>
         Laps alien froth and licks a loathlier mouth. <br>
         Alas, a foul first steam of trodden tares, <br>
         And fouler of these late grapes underfoot. <br>
         A bitter way of waves and clean-cut foam <br>
         Over the sad road of sonorous sea <br>
         The high gods gave king Theseus for no love, <br>
         Nay, but for love, yet to no loving end. <br>
         Alas the long thwarts and the fervent oars, <br>
         And blown hard sails that straightened the scant rope! <br>
         There were no strong pools in the hollow sea <br>
         To drag at them and suck down side and beak, <br>
         No wind to catch them in the teeth and hair, <br>
         No shoal, no shallow among the roaring reefs, <br>
         No gulf whereout the straining tides throw spars, <br>
         No surf where white bones twist like whirled white fire. <br>
         But like to death he came with death, and sought <br>
         And slew and spoiled and gat him that he would. <br>
         For death, for marriage, and for child-getting, <br>
         I set my curse against him as a sword; <br>
         Yea, and the severed half thereof I leave <br>
         Pittheus, because he slew not (when that face <br>
         Was tender, and the life still soft in it) <br>
         
         <center>39<br></center>
         The small swathed child, but bred him for my fate. <br>
         I would I had been the first that took her death <br>
         Out from between wet hoofs and reddened teeth, <br>
         Splashed horns, fierce fetlocks of the brother-bull! <br>
         For now shall I take death a deadlier way, <br>
         Gathering it up between the feet of love <br>
         Or off the knees of murder reaching it.<br>

         <h3>THE TRIUMPH OF TIME</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Before</span> our lives divide for ever, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         While time is with us and hands are free, <br>
         (Time, swift to fasten and swift to sever <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Hand from hand, as we stand by the sea) <br>
         I will say no word that a man might say <br>
         Whose whole life's love goes down in a day; <br>
         For this could never have been; and never, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though the gods and the years relent, shall be.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Is it worth a tear, is it worth an hour, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To think of things that are well outworn? <br>
         Of fruitless husk and fugitive flower, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The dream foregone and the deed forborne? <br>
         Though joy be done with and grief be vain, <br>
         Time shall not sever us wholly in twain; <br>
         Earth is not spoilt for a single shower; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But the rain has ruined the ungrown corn.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         It will grow not again, this fruit of my heart, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Smitten with sunbeams, ruined with rain. <br>
         The singing seasons divide and depart, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Winter and summer depart in twain. <br>
         
         <center>41<br></center>
         It will grow not again, it is ruined at root, <br>
         The bloodlike blossom, the dull red fruit; <br>
         Though the heart yet sickens, the lips yet smart, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With sullen savour of poisonous pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I have given no man of my fruit to eat; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I trod the grapes, I have drunken the wine. <br>
         Had you eaten and drunken and found it sweet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This wild new growth of the corn and vine, <br>
         This wine and bread without lees or leaven, <br>
         We had grown as gods, as the gods in heaven, <br>
         Souls fair to look upon, goodly to greet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One splendid spirit, your soul and mine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In the change of years, in the coil of things, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the clamour and rumour of life to be, <br>
         We, drinking love at the furthest springs, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Covered with love as a covering tree, <br>
         We had grown as gods, as the gods above, <br>
         Filled from the heart to the lips with love, <br>
         Held fast in his hands, clothed warm with his wings, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O love, my love, had you loved but me!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We had stood as the sure stars stand, and moved <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As the moon moves, loving the world; and seen <br>
         Grief collapse as a thing disproved, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Death consume as a thing unclean. <br>
         Twain halves of a perfect heart, made fast <br>
         Soul to soul while the years fell past; <br>
         
         <center>42<br></center>
         Had you loved me once, as you have not loved; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Had the chance been with us that has not been.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I have put my days and dreams out of mind, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Days that are over, dreams that are done. <br>
         Though we seek life through, we shall surely find <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There is none of them clear to us now, not one. <br>
         But clear are these things; the grass and the sand, <br>
         Where, sure as the eyes reach, ever at hand, <br>
         With lips wide open and face burnt blind, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The strong sea-daisies feast on the sun.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The low downs lean to the sea; the stream, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One loose thin pulseless tremulous vein, <br>
         Rapid and vivid and dumb as a dream, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Works downward, sick of the sun and the rain; <br>
         No wind is rough with the rank rare flowers; <br>
         The sweet sea, mother of loves and hours, <br>
         Shudders and shines as the grey winds gleam, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Turning her smile to a fugitive pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Mother of loves that are swift to fade, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Mother of mutable winds and hours. <br>
         A barren mother, a mother-maid, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Cold and clean as her faint salt flowers. <br>
         I would we twain were even as she, <br>
         Lost in the night and the light of the sea, <br>
         Where faint sounds falter and wan beams wade, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Break, and are broken, and shed into showers.<br>
         
         
         <center>43<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The loves and hours of the life of a man, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         They are swift and sad, being born of the sea. <br>
         Hours that rejoice and regret for a span, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Born with a man's breath, mortal as he; <br>
         Loves that are lost ere they come to birth, <br>
         Weeds of the wave, without fruit upon earth. <br>
         I lose what I long for, save what I can, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         My love, my love, and no love for me!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         It is not much that a man can save <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         On the sands of life, in the straits of time, <br>
         Who swims in sight of the great third wave <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That never a swimmer shall cross or climb. <br>
         Some waif washed up with the strays and spars <br>
         That ebb-tide shows to the shore and the stars; <br>
         Weed from the water, grass from a grave, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A broken blossom, a ruined rhyme.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There will no man do for your sake, I think, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What I would have done for the least word said. <br>
         I had wrung life dry for your lips to drink, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Broken it up for your daily bread; <br>
         Body for body and blood for blood, <br>
         As the flow of the full sea risen to flood <br>
         That yearns and trembles before it sink, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I had given, and lain down for you, glad and
         dead.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, hope at highest and all her fruit, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And time at fullest and all his dower, <br>
         
         <center>44<br></center>
         I had given you surely, and life to boot, <br>                
         
         &nbsp;
         Were we once made one for a single hour. <br>
         But now, you are twain, you are cloven apart, <br>
         Flesh of his flesh, but heart of my heart; <br>
         And deep in one is the bitter root, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And sweet for one is the lifelong flower.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         To have died if you cared I should die for you, clung <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To my life if you bade me, played my part <br>
         As it pleased youâthese were the thoughts that stung, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The dreams that smote with a keener dart <br>
         Than shafts of love or arrows of death; <br>
         These were but as fire is, dust, or breath, <br>
         Or poisonous foam on the tender tongue <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of the little snakes that eat my heart.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I wish we were dead together to-day, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lost sight of, hidden away out of sight, <br>
         Clasped and clothed in the cloven clay, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Out of the world's way, out of the light, <br>
         Out of the ages of worldly weather, <br>
         Forgotten of all men altogether,<br>
         As the world's first dead, taken wholly away, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Made one with death, filled full of the night.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         How we should slumber, how we should sleep, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Far in the dark with the dreams and the dews! <br>
         And dreaming, grow to each other, and weep, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Laugh low, live softly, murmur and muse; <br>
         
         <center>45<br></center>
         Yea, and it may be, struck through by the dream, <br>
         Feel the dust quicken and quiver, and seem <br>
         Alive as of old to the lips, and leap <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Spirit to spirit as lovers use.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Sick dreams and sad of a dull delight; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For what shall it profit when men are dead <br>
         To have dreamed, to have loved with the whole soul's might, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To have looked for day when the day was fled? <br>
         Let come what will, there is one thing worth, <br>
         To have had fair love in the life upon earth: <br>
         To have held love safe till the day grew night, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         While skies had colour and lips were red.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Would I lose you now? would I take you then, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If I lose you now that my heart has need? <br>
         And come what may after death to men, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What thing worth this will the dead years breed? <br>
         Lose life, lose all; but at least I know, <br>
         O sweet life's love, having loved you so, <br>
         Had I reached you on earth, I should lose not again, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In death nor life, nor in dream or deed.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, I know this well: were you once sealed mine, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Mine in the blood's beat, mine in the breath, <br>
         Mixed into me as honey in wine, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Not time, that sayeth and gainsayeth,<br>
         
         <center>46<br></center>
         Nor all strong things had severed us then; <br>
         Not wrath of gods, nor wisdom of men, <br>
         Nor all things earthly, nor all divine, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor joy nor sorrow, nor life nor death.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I had grown pure as the dawn and the dew, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         You had grown strong as the sun or the sea. <br>
         But none shall triumph a whole life through: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For death is one, and the fates are three. <br>
         At the door of life, by the gate of breath, <br>
         There are worse things waiting for men than death; <br>
         Death could not sever my soul and you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As these have severed your soul from me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         You have chosen and clung to the chance they sent you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Life sweet as perfume and pure as prayer. <br>
         But will it not one day in heaven repent you? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Will they solace you wholly, the days that were? <br>
         Will you lift up your eyes between sadness and bliss, <br>
         Meet mine, and see where the great love is, <br>
         And tremble and turn and be changed? Content you; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The gate is strait; I shall not be there.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But you, had you chosen, had you stretched hand, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Had you seen good such a thing were done, <br>
         I too might have stood with the souls that stand <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the sun's sight, clothed with the light of the
         sun; <br>
         But who now on earth need care how I live? <br>
         Have the high gods anything left to give, <br>
         
         <center>47<br></center>
         Save dust and laurels and gold and sand? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Which gifts are goodly; but I will none.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O all fair lovers about the world, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There is none of you, none, that shall comfort me. <br>
         My thoughts are as dead things, wrecked and whirled <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Round and round in a gulf of the sea; <br>
         And still, through the sound and the straining stream, <br>
         Through the coil and chafe, they gleam in a dream, <br>
         The bright fine lips so cruelly curled, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And strange swift eyes where the soul sits free.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Free, without pity, withheld from woe, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ignorant; fair as the eyes are fair. <br>
         Would I have you change now, change at a blow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Startled and stricken, awake and aware? <br>
         Yea, if I could, would I have you see <br>
         My very love of you filling me, <br>
         And know my soul to the quick, as I know <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The likeness and look of your throat and hair?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I shall not change you. Nay, though I might, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Would I change my sweet one love with a word? <br>
         I had rather your hair should change in a night, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Clear now as the plume of a black bright bird; <br>
         Your face fail suddenly, cease, turn grey, <br>
         Die as a leaf that dies in a day. <br>
         I will keep my soul in a place out of sight, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Far off, where the pulse of it is not heard.<br>
         
         
         <center>48<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Far off it walks, in a bleak blown space, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Full of the sound of the sorrow of years. <br>
         I have woven a veil for the weeping face, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Whose lips have drunken the wine of tears; <br>
         I have found a way for the failing feet, <br>
         A place for slumber and sorrow to meet; <br>
         There is no rumour about the place, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor light, nor any that sees or hears.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I have hidden my soul out of sight, and said <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         "Let none take pity upon thee, none <br>
         Comfort thy crying: for lo, thou art dead, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lie still now, safe out of sight of the sun. <br>
         Have I not built thee a grave, and wrought <br>
         Thy grave-clothes on thee of grievous thought, <br>
         With soft spun verses and tears unshed, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And sweet light visions of things undone?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "I have given thee garments and balm and myrrh, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And gold, and beautiful burial things. <br>
         But thou, be at peace now, make no stir; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is not thy grave as a royal king's? <br>
         Fret not thyself though the end were sore; <br>
         Sleep, be patient, vex me no more. <br>
         Sleep; what hast thou to do with her? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The eyes that weep, with the mouth that sings?"<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Where the dead red leaves of the years lie rotten, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The cold old crimes and the deeds thrown by, <br>
         
         <center>49<br></center>
         The misconceived and the misbegotten, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I would find a sin to do ere I die, <br>
         Sure to dissolve and destroy me all through, <br>
         That would set you higher in heaven, serve you <br>
         And leave you happy, when clean forgotten, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As a dead man out of mind, am I.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Your lithe hands draw me, your face burns through me, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I am swift to follow you, keen to see; <br>
         But love lacks might to redeem or undo me; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As I have been, I know I shall surely be; <br>
         "What should such fellows as I do?" Nay, <br>
         My part were worse if I chose to play;<br>
         For the worst is this after all; if they knew me, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Not a soul upon earth would pity me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And I play not for pity of these; but you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If you saw with your soul what man am I, <br>
         You would praise me at least that my soul all through <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Clove to you, loathing the lives that lie; <br>
         The souls and lips that are bought and sold, <br>
         The smiles of silver and kisses of gold, <br>
         The lapdog loves that whine as they chew, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The little lovers that curse and cry.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There are fairer women, I hear; that may be; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But I, that I love you and find you fair, <br>
         Who are more than fair in my eyes if they be, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Do the high gods know or the great gods care? <br>
         
         <center>50<br></center>
         Though the swords in my heart for one were seven, <br>
         Should the iron hollow of doubtful heaven, <br>
         That knows not itself whether night-time or day be, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Reverberate words and a foolish prayer?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I will go back to the great sweet mother, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Mother and lover of men, the sea. <br>
         I will go down to her, I and none other, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Close with her, kiss her and mix her with me; <br>
         Cling to her, strive with her, hold her fast; <br>
         O fair white mother, in days long past <br>
         Born without sister, born without brother, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Set free my soul as thy soul is free.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O fair green-girdled mother of mine, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sea, that art clothed with the sun and the rain, <br>
         Thy sweet hard kisses are strong like wine, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy large embraces are keen like pain.<br>
         Save me and hide me with all thy waves, <br>
         Find me one grave of thy thousand graves, <br>
         Those pure cold populous graves of thine, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wrought without hand in a world without stain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I shall sleep, and move with the moving ships, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Change as the winds change, veer in the tide; <br>
         My lips will feast on the foam of thy lips, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I shall rise with thy rising, with thee subside; <br>
         Sleep, and not know if she be, if she were, <br>
         Filled full with life to the eyes and hair, <br>
         
         <center>51<br></center>
         As a rose is fulfilled to the roseleaf tips <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With splendid summer and perfume and pride.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         This woven raiment of nights and days, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Were it once cast off and unwound from me, <br>
         Naked and glad would I walk in thy ways, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Alive and aware of thy ways and thee; <br>
         Clear of the whole world, hidden at home, <br>
         Clothed with the green and crowned with the foam, <br>
         A pulse of the life of thy straits and bays, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A vein in the heart of the streams of the sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Fair mother, fed with the lives of men, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou art subtle and cruel of heart, men say. <br>
         Thou hast taken, and shalt not render again; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou art full of thy dead, and cold as they. <br>
         But death is the worst that comes of thee; <br>
         Thou art fed with our dead, O mother, O sea, <br>
         But when hast thou fed on our hearts? or when, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Having given us love, hast thou taken away?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O tender-hearted, O perfect lover, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy lips are bitter, and sweet thine heart.<br>
         The hopes that hurt and the dreams that hover, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall they not vanish away and apart? <br>
         But thou, thou art sure, thou art older than earth; <br>
         Thou art strong for death and fruitful of birth; <br>
         Thy depths conceal and thy gulfs discover; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From the first thou wert; in the end thou art.<br>
         
         
         <center>52<br></center>
         <br><br>
         And grief shall endure not for ever, I know. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As things that are not shall these things be; <br>
         We shall live through seasons of sun and of snow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And none be grievous as this to me. <br>
         We shall hear, as one in a trance that hears, <br>
         The sound of time, the rhyme of the years; <br>
         Wrecked hope and passionate pain will grow <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As tender things of a spring-tide sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Sea-fruit that swings in the waves that hiss, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Drowned gold and purple and royal rings. <br>
         And all time past, was it all for this? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Times unforgotten, and treasures of things? <br>
         Swift years of liking and sweet long laughter, <br>
         That wist not well of the years thereafter <br>
         Till love woke, smitten at heart by a kiss, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With lips that trembled and trailing wings?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There lived a singer in France of old <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         By the tideless dolorous midland sea. <br>
         In a land of sand and ruin and gold <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There shone one woman, and none but she. <br>
         And finding life for her love's sake fail, <br>
         Being fain to see her, he bade set sail, <br>
         Touched land, and saw her as life grew cold, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And praised God, seeing; and so died he.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Died, praising God for his gift and grace: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For she bowed down to him weeping, and said <br>
         
         <center>53<br></center>
         "Live"; and her tears were shed on his face <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or ever the life in his face was shed. <br>
         The sharp tears fell through her hair, and stung <br>
         Once, and her close lips touched him and clung <br>
         Once, and grew one with his lips for a space; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And so drew back, and the man was dead.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O brother, the gods were good to you. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sleep, and be glad while the world endures. <br>
         Be well content as the years wear through; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Give thanks for life, and the loves and lures; <br>
         Give thanks for life, O brother, and death, <br>
         For the sweet last sound of her feet, her breath, <br>
         For gifts she gave you, gracious and few, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Tears and kisses, that lady of yours.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Rest, and be glad of the gods; but I, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         How shall I praise them, or how take rest? <br>
         There is not room under all the sky <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For me that know not of worst or best, <br>
         Dream or desire of the days before, <br>
         Sweet things or bitterness, any more. <br>
         Love will not come to me now though I die, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As love came close to you, breast to breast.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I shall never be friends again with roses; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I shall loathe sweet tunes, where a note grown
         strong <br>
         Relents and recoils, and climbs and closes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As a wave of the sea turned back by song. <br>
         
         <center>54<br></center>
         There are sounds where the soul's delight takes fire, <br>
         Face to face with its own desire;<br>
         A delight that rebels, a desire that reposes; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I shall hate sweet music my whole life long.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The pulse of war and passion of wonder, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The heavens that murmur, the sounds that shine, <br>
         The stars that sing and the loves that thunder, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The music burning at heart like wine, <br>
         An armed archangel whose hands raise up <br>
         All senses mixed in the spirit's cup <br>
         Till flesh and spirit are molten in sunder â <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         These things are over, and no more mine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         These were a part of the playing I heard <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Once, ere my love and my heart were at strife; <br>
         Love that sings and hath wings as a bird, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Balm of the wound and heft of the knife. <br>
         Fairer than earth is the sea, and sleep <br>
         Than overwatching of eyes that weep, <br>
         Now time has done with his one sweet word, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The wine and leaven of lovely life.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I shall go my ways, tread out my measure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fill the days of my daily breath <br>
         With fugitive things not good to treasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Do as the world doth, say as it saith; <br>
         But if we had loved each otherâO sweet, <br>
         Had you felt, lying under the palms of your feet, <br>
         
         <center>55<br></center>
         The heart of my heart, beating harder with pleasure <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To feel you tread it to dust and deathâ <br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah, had I not taken my life up and given <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All that life gives and the years let go, <br>
         The wine and honey, the balm and leaven, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The dreams reared high and the hopes brought low?<br>
         Come life, come death, not a word be said; <br>
         Should I lose you living, and vex you dead? <br>
         I never shall tell you on earth; and in heaven, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If I cry to you then, will you hear or know? <br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Whatever</span> a man of the sons of men <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall say to his heart of the lords above, <br>
         They have shown man verily, once and again, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Marvellous mercies and infinite love.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In the wild fifth year of the change of things, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When France was glorious and blood-red, fair <br>
         With dust of battle and deaths of kings, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A queen of men, with helmeted hair,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Carrier came down to the Loire and slew, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till all the ways and the waves waxed red: <br>
         Bound and drowned, slaying two by two, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Maidens and young men, naked and wed.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They brought on a day to his judgment-place <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One rough with labour and red with fight, <br>
         And a lady noble by name and face, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Faultless, a maiden, wonderful, white.<br>
         
         
         <center>57<br></center>
         <br><br>
         She knew not, being for shame's sake blind, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If his eyes were hot on her face hard by. <br>
         And the judge bade strip and ship them, and bind <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Bosom to bosom, to drown and die.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The white girl winced and whitened; but he <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Caught fire, waxed bright as a great bright flame <br>
         Seen with thunder far out on the sea, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Laughed hard as the glad blood went and came.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Twice his lips quailed with delight, then said, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         "I have but a word to you all, one word; <br>
         Bear with me; surely I am but dead;" <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And all they laughed and mocked him and heard.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "Judge, when they open the judgment-roll, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I will stand upright before God and pray: <br>
         'Lord God, have mercy on one man's soul, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For his mercy was great upon earth, I say.<br>

         I fought with, sparing not one, nor swerved <br>

          <i>Sit thou for him at my feet on a throne.</i> <br>
         I will face thy wrath, though it bite as a sword, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And my soul shall burn for his soul, and atone.<br>

         &nbsp;
         How gracious on earth were his deeds towards me. <br>
         Shall this be a small thing in thine eyes, <br>

         That is greater in mine than the whole great

         Living? but now I shall have you dead.<br>

         I shall drown with her, laughing for love; and she <br>

         Mix with me, touching me, lips and eyes.<br>

         &nbsp;
         Me, on whose heart as a worm she trod? <br>
         You have given me, God requite it you, <br>

         What man yet never was given of God."<br>

         O sweet one love, O my life's delight, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Dear, though the days have divided us, <br>
         Lost beyond hope, taken far out of sight, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Not twice in the world shall the gods do thus.<br>
         
         
         <center>59<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Had it been so hard for my love? but I, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though the gods gave all that a god can give, <br>
         I had chosen rather the gift to die, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Cease, and be glad above all that live.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For the Loire would have driven us down to the sea, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the sea would have pitched us from shoal to
         shoal; <br>
         And I should have held you, and you held me, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As flesh holds flesh, and the soul the soul.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Could I change you, help you to love me, sweet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Could I give you the love that would sweeten death,<br>
         We should yield, go down, locked hands and feet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Die, drown together, and breath catch breath;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But you would have felt my soul in a kiss, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And known that once if I loved you well; <br>
         And I would have given my soul for this <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To burn for ever in burning hell. <br>

         <h3>A LEAVE-TAKING</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Let</span> us go hence, my songs; she will not hear. <br>
         Let us go hence together without fear; <br>
         Keep silence now, for singing-time is over, <br>
         And over all old things and all things dear. <br>
         She loves not you nor me as all we love her. <br>
         Yea, though we sang as angels in her ear, <br>
         She would not hear.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let us rise up and part; she will not know. <br>
         Let us go seaward as the great winds go, <br>
         Full of blown sand and foam; what help is here? <br>
         There is no help, for all these things are so, <br>
         And all the world is bitter as a tear. <br>
         And how these things are, though ye strove to show, <br>
         She would not know.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let us go home and hence; she will not weep. <br>
         We gave love many dreams and days to keep, <br>
         Flowers without scent, and fruits that would not grow, <br>
         Saying `If thou wilt, thrust in thy sickle and reap.' <br>
         
         <center>61<br></center>All is reaped now; no grass is left to mow; <br>
         And we that sowed, though all we fell on sleep, <br>
         She would not weep.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let us go hence and rest; she will not love. <br>
         She shall not hear us if we sing hereof, <br>
         Nor see love's ways, how sore they are and steep. <br>
         Come hence, let be, lie still; it is enough. <br>
         Love is a barren sea, bitter and deep; <br>
         And though she saw all heaven in flower above, <br>
         She would not love.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let us give up, go down; she will not care. <br>
         Though all the stars made gold of all the air, <br>
         And the sea moving saw before it move <br>
         One moon-flower making all the foam-flowers fair; <br>
         Though all those waves went over us, and drove <br>
         Deep down the stifling lips and drowning hair, <br>
         She would not care.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let us go hence, go hence; she will not see. <br>
         Sing all once more together; surely she, <br>
         She too, remembering days and words that were, <br>
         Will turn a little toward us, sighing; but we, <br>
         We are hence, we are gone, as though we had not been there. <br>
         Nay, and though all men seeing had pity on me, <br>
         She would not see. <br>

         &nbsp;
         How can thine heart be full of the spring? <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         A thousand summers are over and dead. <br>
         What hast thou found in the spring to follow? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What hast thou found in thine heart to sing? <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         What wilt thou do when the summer is shed?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O swallow, sister, O fair swift swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Why wilt thou fly after spring to the south, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The soft south whither thine heart is set? <br>
         Shall not the grief of the old time follow? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall not the song thereof cleave to thy mouth? <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Hast thou forgotten ere I forget?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Sister, my sister, O fleet sweet swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy way is long to the sun and the south; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But I, fulfilled of my heart's desire, <br>
         Shedding my song upon height, upon hollow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From tawny body and sweet small mouth <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Feed the heart of the night with fire.<br>
          
         <center>63<br></center>
         <br><br>
         I the nightingale all spring through, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O swallow, sister, O changing swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         All spring through till the spring be done, <br>
         Clothed with the light of the night on the dew, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sing, while the hours and the wild birds follow, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Take flight and follow and find the sun.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Sister, my sister, O soft light swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though all things feast in the spring's
         guest-chamber, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         How hast thou heart to be glad thereof yet? <br>
         For where thou fliest I shall not follow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till life forget and death remember, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Till thou remember and I forget.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Swallow, my sister, O singing swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I know not how thou hast heart to sing. <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Hast thou the heart? is it all past over? <br>
         Thy lord the summer is good to follow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And fair the feet of thy lover the spring: <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But what wilt thou say to the spring thy lover?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O swallow, sister, O fleeting swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         My heart in me is a molten ember <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And over my head the waves have met. <br>
         But thou wouldst tarry or I would follow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Could I forget or thou remember, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Couldst thou remember and I forget.<br>
          
         <center>64<br></center>
         <br><br>
         O sweet stray sister, O shifting swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The heart's division divideth us. <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thy heart is light as a leaf of a tree; <br>
         But mine goes forth among sea-gulfs hollow <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To the place of the slaying of Itylus, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The feast of Daulis, the Thracian sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O swallow, sister, O rapid swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I pray thee sing not a little space. <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Are not the roofs and the lintels wet? <br>
         The woven web that was plain to follow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The small slain body, the flowerlike face, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Can I remember if thou forget?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O sister, sister, thy first-begotten! <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The hands that cling and the feet that follow, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The voice of the child's blood crying yet <br>
         
         Who hath remembered me? who hath forgotten?
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou hast forgotten, O summer swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But the world shall end when I forget. <br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">My</span> life is bitter with thy love; thine eyes <br>
         Blind me, thy tresses burn me, thy sharp sighs <br>
         Divide my flesh and spirit with soft sound, <br>
         And my blood strengthens, and my veins abound. <br>
         I pray thee sigh not, speak not, draw not breath; <br>
         Let life burn down, and dream it is not death. <br>
         I would the sea had hidden us, the fire <br>
         (Wilt thou fear that, and fear not my desire?) <br>
         Severed the bones that bleach, the flesh that cleaves, <br>
         And let our sifted ashes drop like leaves. <br>
         I feel thy blood against my blood: my pain <br>
         Pains thee, and lips bruise lips, and vein stings vein. <br>
         Let fruit be crushed on fruit, let flower on flower, <br>
         Breast kindle breast, and either burn one hour. <br>
         Why wilt thou follow lesser loves? are thine <br>
         Too weak to bear these hands and lips of mine? <br>
         I charge thee for my life's sake, O too sweet <br>

         I charge thee keep thy lips from hers or his, <br>
         Sweetest, till theirs be sweeter than my kiss: <br>
         Lest I too lure, a swallow for a dove, <br>
         Erotion or Erinna to my love.<br>
         I would my love could kill thee; I am satiated <br>
         With seeing the live, and fain would have thee dead. <br>
         I would earth had thy body as fruit to eat, <br>
         And no mouth but some serpent's found thee sweet. <br>
         I would find grievous ways to have thee slain, <br>
         Intense device, and superflux of pain; <br>
         Vex thee with amorous agonies, and shake <br>
         Life at thy lips, and leave it there to ache; <br>
         Strain out thy soul with pangs too soft to kill, <br>
         Intolerable interludes, and infinite ill; <br>
         Relapse and reluctation of the breath, <br>
         Dumb tunes and shuddering semitones of death. <br>
         I am weary of all thy words and soft strange ways, <br>
         Of all love's fiery nights and all his days, <br>
         And all the broken kisses salt as brine <br>
         That shuddering lips make moist with waterish wine, <br>
         And eyes the bluer for all those hidden hours <br>
         That pleasure fills with tears and feeds from flowers, <br>
         Fierce at the heart with fire that half comes through, <br>
         But all the flower-like white stained round with blue; <br>
         The fervent underlid, and that above <br>
         Lifted with laughter or abashed with love; <br>
         Thine amorous girdle, full of thee and fair, <br>
         And leavings of the lilies in thine hair. <br>
         
         <center>67<br></center>
         Yea, all sweet words of thine and all thy ways, <br>
         And all the fruit of nights and flower of days, <br>
         And stinging lips wherein the hot sweet brine <br>
         That Love was born of burns and foams like wine, <br>
         And eyes insatiable of amorous hours, <br>
         Fervent as fire and delicate as flowers, <br>
         Coloured like night at heart, but cloven through <br>
         Like night with flame, dyed round like night with blue,<br>
         Clothed with deep eyelids under and aboveâ <br>
         Yea, all thy beauty sickens me with love; <br>
         Thy girdle empty of thee and now not fair, <br>
         And ruinous lilies in thy languid hair. <br>
         Ah, take no thought for Love's sake; shall this be, <br>
         And she who loves thy lover not love thee? <br>
         Sweet soul, sweet mouth of all that laughs and lives, <br>
         Mine is she, very mine; and she forgives. <br>
         For I beheld in sleep the light that is <br>
         In her high place in Paphos, heard the kiss <br>
         Of body and soul that mix with eager tears <br>
         And laughter stinging through the eyes and ears; <br>
         Saw Love, as burning flame from crown to feet, <br>
         Imperishable, upon her storied seat; <br>
         Clear eyelids lifted toward the north and south, <br>
         A mind of many colours, and a mouth <br>
         Of many tunes and kisses; and she bowed, <br>
         With all her subtle face laughing aloud, <br>
         Bowed down upon me, saying, âWho doth thee wrong, <br>
         Sappho?â but thouâthy body is the song, <br>
         
         <center>68<br></center>
         Thy mouth the music; thou art more than I, <br>
         Though my voice die not till the whole world die; <br>
         Though men that hear it madden; though love weep, <br>
         Though nature change, though shame be charmed asleep. <br>
         Ah, wilt thou slay me lest I kiss thee dead? <br>
         Yet the queen laughed from her sweet heart and said: <br>
         âEven she that flies shall follow for thy sake, <br>
         And she shall give thee gifts that would not take, <br>
         Shall kiss that would not kiss theeâ (yea, kiss me) <br>
         âWhen thou wouldst notââwhen I would not kiss
         thee!<br>
         Ah, more to me than all men as thou art, <br>
         Shall not my songs assuage her at the heart? <br>
         Ah, sweet to me as life seems sweet to death, <br>
         Why should her wrath fill thee with fearful breath? <br>
         Nay, sweet, for is she God alone? hath she <br>
         Made earth and all the centuries of the sea, <br>
         Taught the sun ways to travel, woven most fine <br>
         The moonbeams, shed the starbeams forth as wine, <br>
         Bound with her myrtles, beaten with her rods, <br>
         The young men and the maidens and the gods? <br>
         Have we not lips to love with, eyes for tears, <br>
         And summer and flower of women and of years? <br>
         Stars for the foot of morning, and for noon <br>
         Sunlight, and exaltation of the moon; <br>
         Waters that answer waters, fields that wear <br>
         Lilies, and languor of the Lesbian air? <br>
         Beyond those flying feet of fluttered doves, <br>
         Are there not other gods for other loves? <br>
         
         <center>69<br></center>
         Yea, though she scourge thee, sweetest, for my sake, <br>
         Blossom not thorns and flowers not blood should break. <br>
         Ah that my lips were tuneless lips, but pressed <br>
         To the bruised blossom of thy scourged white breast! <br>
         Ah that my mouth for Muses' milk were fed <br>
         On the sweet blood thy sweet small wounds had bled! <br>
         That with my tongue I felt them, and could taste <br>
         The faint flakes from thy bosom to the waist! <br>
         That I could drink thy veins as wine, and eat <br>
         Thy breasts like honey! that from face to feet <br>
         Thy body were abolished and consumed, <br>
         And in my flesh thy very flesh entombed!<br>
         Ah, ah, thy beauty! like a beast it bites, <br>
         Stings like an adder, like an arrow smites. <br>
         Ah sweet, and sweet again, and seven times sweet, <br>
         The paces and the pauses of thy feet! <br>
         Ah sweeter than all sleep or summer air <br>
         The fallen fillets fragrant from thine hair! <br>
         Yea, though their alien kisses do me wrong, <br>
         Sweeter thy lips than mine with all their song; <br>
         Thy shoulders whiter than a fleece of white, <br>
         And flower-sweet fingers, good to bruise or bite <br>
         As honeycomb of the inmost honey-cells, <br>
         With almond-shaped and roseleaf-coloured shells, <br>
         And blood like purple blossom at the tips <br>
         Quivering; and pain made perfect in thy lips <br>
         For my sake when I hurt thee; O that I <br>
         Durst crush thee out of life with love, and die, <br> 
         <center>70<br></center>
         Die of thy pain and my delight, and be <br>
         Mixed with thy blood and molten into thee! <br>
         Would I not plague thee dying overmuch? <br>
         Would I not hurt thee perfectly? not touch <br>
         Thy pores of sense with torture, and make bright <br>
         Thine eyes with bloodlike tears and grievous light? <br>
         Strike pang from pang as note is struck from note, <br>
         Catch the sob's middle music in thy throat, <br>
         Take thy limbs living, and new-mould with these <br>
         A lyre of many faultless agonies? <br>
         Feed thee with fever and famine and fine drouth, <br>
         With perfect pangs convulse thy perfect mouth, <br>
         Make thy life shudder in thee and burn afresh, <br>
         And wring thy very spirit through the flesh? <br>
         Cruel? but love makes all that love him well <br>
         As wise as heaven and crueller than hell. <br>
         Me hath love made more bitter toward thee <br>
         Than death toward man; but were I made as he<br>
         Who hath made all things to break them one by one, <br>
         If my feet trod upon the stars and sun <br>
         And souls of men as his have alway trod, <br>
         God knows I might be crueller than God. <br>
         For who shall change with prayers or thanksgivings <br>
         The mystery of the cruelty of things? <br>
         Or say what God above all gods and years, <br>
         With offering and blood-sacrifice of tears, <br>
         With lamentation from strange lands, from graves <br>
         Where the snake pastures, from scarred mouths of slaves, <br>
         
         <center>71<br></center>
         From prison, and from plunging prows of ships <br>
         Through flamelike foam of the sea's closing lipsâ <br>
         With thwartings of strange signs, and wind-blown hair <br>
         Of comets, desolating the dim air, <br>
         When darkness is made fast with seals and bars, <br>
         And fierce reluctance of disastrous stars, <br>
         Eclipse, and sound of shaken hills, and wings <br>
         Darkening, and blind inexpiable thingsâ <br>
         With sorrow of labouring moons, and altering light <br>
         And travail of the planets of the night, <br>
         And weeping of the weary Pleiads seven, <br>
         Feeds the mute melancholy lust of heaven? <br>
         Is not his incense bitterness, his meat <br>
         Murder? his hidden face and iron feet <br>
         Hath not man known, and felt them on their way <br>
         Threaten and trample all things and every day? <br>
         Hath he not sent us hunger? who hath cursed <br>
         Spirit and flesh with longing? filled with thirst <br>
         Their lips who cried unto him? who bade exceed <br>
         The fervid will, fall short the feeble deed, <br>
         Bade sink the spirit and the flesh aspire, <br>
         Pain animate the dust of dead desire,<br>
         And life yield up her flower to violent fate? <br>
         Him would I reach, him smite, him desecrate, <br>
         Pierce the cold lips of God with human breath, <br>
         And mix his immortality with death. <br>
         Why hath he made us? what had all we done <br>
         That we should live and loathe the sterile sun, <br> 
         
         <center>72<br></center>
         And with the moon wax paler as she wanes, <br>
         And pulse by pulse feel time grow through our veins? <br>
         Thee too the years shall cover; thou shalt be <br>
         As the rose born of one same blood with thee, <br>
         As a song sung, as a word said, and fall <br>
         Flower-wise, and be not any more at all, <br>
         Nor any memory of thee anywhere; <br>
         For never Muse has bound above thine hair <br>
         The high Pierian flower whose graft outgrows <br>
         All summer kinship of the mortal rose <br>
         And colour of deciduous days, nor shed <br>
         Reflex and flush of heaven about thine head, <br>
         Nor reddened brows made pale by floral grief <br>
         With splendid shadow from that lordlier leaf. <br>
         Yea, thou shalt be forgotten like spilt wine, <br>
         Except these kisses of my lips on thine <br>
         Brand them with immortality; but meâ <br>
         Men shall not see bright fire nor hear the sea, <br>
         Nor mix their hearts with music, nor behold <br>
         Cast forth of heaven with feet of awful gold <br>
         And plumeless wings that make the bright air blind, <br>
         Lightning, with thunder for a hound behind <br>
         Hunting through fields unfurrowed and unsownâ <br>
         But in the light and laughter, in the moan <br>
         And music, and in grasp of lip and hand <br>
         And shudder of water that makes felt on land<br>
         The immeasurable tremor of all the sea, <br>
         Memories shall mix and metaphors of me. <br> 
         
         <center>73<br></center>
         Like me shall be the shuddering calm of night, <br>
         When all the winds of the world for pure delight <br>
         Close lips that quiver and fold up wings that ache; <br>
         When nightingales are louder for love's sake, <br>
         And leaves tremble like lute-strings or like fire; <br>
         Like me the one star swooning with desire <br>
         Even at the cold lips of the sleepless moon, <br>
         As I at thine; like me the waste white noon, <br>
         Burnt through with barren sunlight; and like me <br>
         The land-stream and the tide-stream in the sea. <br>
         I am sick with time as these with ebb and flow, <br>
         And by the yearning in my veins I know <br>
         The yearning sound of waters; and mine eyes <br>
         Burn as that beamless fire which fills the skies <br>
         With troubled stars and travailing things of flame; <br>
         And in my heart the grief consuming them <br>
         Labours, and in my veins the thirst of these, <br>
         And all the summer travail of the trees <br>
         And all the winter sickness; and the earth, <br>
         Filled full with deadly works of death and birth, <br>
         Sore spent with hungry lusts of birth and death, <br>
         Has pain like mine in her divided breath; <br>
         Her spring of leaves is barren, and her fruit <br>
         Ashes; her boughs are burdened, and her root <br>
         Fibrous and gnarled with poison; underneath <br>
         Serpents have gnawn it through with tortuous teeth <br>
         Made sharp upon the bones of all the dead, <br>
         And wild birds rend her branches overhead. <br> 
         
         <center>74<br></center>
         These, woven as raiment for his word and thought, <br>
         These hath God made, and me as these, and wrought <br>
         Song, and hath lit it at my lips; and me <br>
         Earth shall not gather though she feed on thee.<br>
         As a shed tear shalt thou be shed; but Iâ <br>
         Lo, earth may labour, men live long and die, <br>
         Years change and stars, and the high God devise <br>
         New things, and old things wane before his eyes <br>
         Who wields and wrecks them, being more strong than theyâ <br>
         But, having made me, me he shall not slay. <br>
         Nor slay nor satiate, like those herds of his <br>
         Who laugh and live a little, and their kiss <br>
         Contents them, and their loves are swift and sweet, <br>
         And sure death grasps and gains them with slow feet, <br>
         Love they or hate they, strive or bow their kneesâ <br>
         And all these end; he hath his will of these. <br>
         Yea, but albeit he slay me, hating meâ <br>
         Albeit he hide me in the deep dear sea <br>
         And cover me with cool wan foam, and ease <br>
         This soul of mine as any soul of these, <br>
         And give me water and great sweet waves, and make <br>
         The very sea's name lordlier for my sake, <br>
         The whole sea sweeterâalbeit I die indeed <br>
         And hide myself and sleep and no man heed, <br>
         Of me the high God hath not all his will. <br>
         Blossom of branches, and on each high hill <br> 
         
         <center>75<br></center>
         Clear air and wind, and under in clamorous vales <br>
         Fierce noises of the fiery nightingales, <br>
         Buds burning in the sudden spring like fire, <br>
         The wan washed sand and the waves' vain desire, <br>
         Sails seen like blown white flowers at sea, and words <br>
         That bring tears swiftest, and long notes of birds <br>
         Violently singing till the whole world singsâ <br>
         I Sappho shall be one with all these things, <br>
         With all high things for ever; and my face <br>
         Seen once, my songs once heard in a strange place,<br>
         Cleave to men's lives, and waste the days thereof <br>
         With gladness and much sadness and long love. <br>
         Yea, they shall say, earth's womb has borne in vain <br>
         New things, and never this best thing again; <br>
         Borne days and men, borne fruits and wars and wine, <br>
         Seasons and songs, but no song more like mine. <br>
         And they shall know me as ye who have known me here, <br>
         Last year when I loved Atthis, and this year <br>
         When I love thee; and they shall praise me, and say <br>
         âShe hath all time as all we have our day, <br>
         Shall she not live and have her willââeven I? <br>
         Yea, though thou diest, I say I shall not die. <br>
         For these shall give me of their souls, shall give <br>
         Life, and the days and loves wherewith I live, <br>
         Shall quicken me with loving, fill with breath, <br>
         Save me and serve me, strive for me with death. <br>
         Alas, that neither moon nor snow nor dew <br>
         Nor all cold things can purge me wholly through, <br>
         
         <center>76<br></center>
         Assuage me nor allay me nor appease, <br>
         Till supreme sleep shall bring me bloodless ease; <br>
         Till time wax faint in all his periods; <br>
         Till fate undo the bondage of the gods, <br>
         And lay, to slake and satiate me all through, <br>
         Lotus and Lethe on my lips like dew, <br>
         And shed around and over and under me <br>
         Thick darkness and the insuperable sea. <br>

         <h3>HYMN TO PROSERPINE</h3>
         
         <h3>(AFTER THE PROCLAMATION IN ROME OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH.)</h3>
         
         Vicisti, GalilÃ¦e.
         
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">I have</span> lived long enough, having seen one thing, that love
         hath an end; <br>
         Goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and befriend. <br>
         Thou art more than the day or the morrow, the seasons that laugh
         or that weep; <br>
         For these give joy and sorrow; but thou, Proserpina, sleep. <br>
         Sweet is the treading of wine, and sweet the feet of the dove; <br>
         But a goodlier gift is thine than foam of the grapes or love. <br>
         Yea, is not even Apollo, with hair and harpstring of gold, <br>
         A bitter God to follow, a beautiful God to behold? <br>
         I am sick of singing: the bays burn deep and chafe: I am fain <br>
         To rest a little from praise and grievous pleasure and pain. <br>
         For the Gods we know not of, who give us our daily breath, <br>
         We know they are cruel as love or life, and lovely as death.<br>
         
         <center>78<br></center>
         O Gods dethroned and deceased, cast forth, wiped out in a day! <br>
         From your wrath is the world released, redeemed from your chains,
         men say. <br>
         New Gods are crowned in the city; their flowers have broken your
         rods; <br>
         They are merciful, clothed with pity, the young compassionate
         Gods. <br>
         But for me their new device is barren, the days are bare; <br>
         Things long past over suffice, and men forgotten that were. <br>
         Time and the Gods are at strife; ye dwell in the midst thereof, <br>
         Draining a little life from the barren breasts of love. <br>
         I say to you, cease, take rest; yea, I say to you all, be at
         peace, <br>
         Till the bitter milk of her breast and the barren bosom shall
         cease. <br>
         Wilt thou yet take all, Galilean? but these thou shalt not take, <br>
         The laurel, the palms and the pÃ¦an, the breasts of the nymphs in
         the brake; <br>
         Breasts more soft than a dove's, that tremble with tenderer
         breath; <br>
         And all the wings of the Loves, and all the joy before death; <br>
         All the feet of the hours that sound as a single lyre, <br>
         Dropped and deep in the flowers, with strings that flicker like
         fire. <br> 
         
         <center>79<br></center>
         More than these wilt thou give, things fairer than all these
         things? <br>
         Nay, for a little we live, and life hath mutable wings.<br>
         A little while and we die; shall life not thrive as it may? <br>
         For no man under the sky lives twice, outliving his day. <br>
         And grief is a grievous thing, and a man hath enough of his
         tears: <br>
         Why should he labour, and bring fresh grief to blacken his years? <br>
         Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey
         from thy breath; <br>
         We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fulness of
         death. <br>
         Laurel is green for a season, and love is sweet for a day; <br>
         But love grows bitter with treason, and laurel outlives not May. <br>
         Sleep, shall we sleep after all? for the world is not sweet in
         the end; <br>
         For the old faiths loosen and fall, the new years ruin and rend. <br>
         Fate is a sea without shore, and the soul is a rock that abides; <br>
         But her ears are vexed with the roar and her face with the foam
         of the tides. <br>
         O lips that the live blood faints in, the leavings of racks and
         rods! <br>
         O ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted Gods! <br>
         
         <center>80<br></center>
         Though all men abase them before you in spirit, and all knees
         bend, <br>
         I kneel not neither adore you, but standing, look to the end. <br>
         All delicate days and pleasant, all spirits and sorrows are cast <br>
         Far out with the foam of the present that sweeps to the surf of
         the past:<br>
         Where beyond the extreme sea-wall, and between the remote
         sea-gates, <br>
         Waste water washes, and tall ships founder, and deep death waits: <br>
         Where, mighty with deepening sides, clad about with the seas as
         with wings, <br>
         And impelled of invisible tides, and fulfilled of unspeakable
         things, <br>
         White-eyed and poisonous-finned, shark-toothed and
         serpentine-curled, <br>
         Rolls, under the whitening wind of the future, the wave of the
         world. <br>
         The depths stand naked in sunder behind it, the storms flee away; <br>
         In the hollow before it the thunder is taken and snared as a
         prey; <br>
         In its sides is the north-wind bound; and its salt is of all
         men's tears; <br>
         With light of ruin, and sound of changes, and pulse of years: <br>
         
         <center>81<br></center>
         With travail of day after day, and with trouble of hour upon
         hour; <br>
         And bitter as blood is the spray; and the crests are as fangs
         that devour: <br>
         And its vapour and storm of its steam as the sighing of spirits
         to be; <br>
         And its noise as the noise in a dream; and its depth as the roots
         of the sea: <br>
         And the height of its heads as the height of the utmost stars of
         the air: <br>
         And the ends of the earth at the might thereof tremble, and time
         is made bare. <br>
         Will ye bridle the deep sea with reins, will ye chasten the high
         sea with rods?<br>
         Will ye take her to chain her with chains, who is older than all
         ye Gods? <br>
         All ye as a wind shall go by, as a fire shall ye pass and be
         past; <br>
         Ye are Gods, and behold, ye shall die, and the waves be upon you
         at last. <br>
         In the darkness of time, in the deeps of the years, in the
         changes of things, <br>
         Ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps, and the world shall forget
         you for kings. <br>
         Though the feet of thine high priests tread where thy lords and
         our forefathers trod, <br>
         Though these that were Gods are dead, and thou being dead art a
         God, <br>
         
         <center>82<br></center>
         Though before thee the throned Cytherean be fallen, and hidden
         her head, <br>
         Yet thy kingdom shall pass, Galilean, thy dead shall go down to
         thee dead. <br>
         Of the maiden thy mother men sing as a goddess with grace clad
         around; <br>
         Thou art throned where another was king; where another was queen
         she is crowned. <br>
         Yea, once we had sight of another: but now she is queen, say
         these. <br>
         Not as thine, not as thine was our mother, a blossom of flowering
         seas, <br>
         Clothed round with the world's desire as with raiment, and fair
         as the foam, <br>
         And fleeter than kindled fire, and a goddess, and mother of Rome. <br>
         For thine came pale and a maiden, and sister to sorrow; but ours, <br>
         Her deep hair heavily laden with odour and colour of flowers,<br>
         White rose of the rose-white water, a silver splendour, a flame, <br>
         Bent down unto us that besought her, and earth grew sweet with
         her name. <br>
         For thine came weeping, a slave among slaves, and rejected; but
         she <br>
         Came flushed from the full-flushed wave, and imperial, her foot
         on the sea. <br>
         And the wonderful waters knew her, the winds and the viewless
         ways, <br>
         
         <center>83<br></center>
         And the roses grew rosier, and bluer the sea-blue stream of the
         bays. <br>
         Ye are fallen, our lords, by what token? we wist that ye should
         not fall. <br>
         Ye were all so fair that are broken; and one more fair than ye
         all. <br>
         But I turn to her still, having seen she shall surely abide in
         the end; <br>
         Goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and befriend. <br>
         O daughter of earth, of my mother, her crown and blossom of
         birth, <br>
         I am also, I also, thy brother; I go as I came unto earth. <br>
         In the night where thine eyes are as moons are in heaven, the
         night where thou art, <br>
         Where the silence is more than all tunes, where sleep overflows
         from the heart, <br>
         Where the poppies are sweet as the rose in our world, and the red
         rose is white, <br>
         And the wind falls faint as it blows with the fume of the flowers
         of the night, <br>
         And the murmur of spirits that sleep in the shadow of Gods from
         afar<br>
         Grows dim in thine ears and deep as the deep dim soul of a star, <br>
         
         <center>84<br></center>
         In the sweet low light of thy face, under heavens untrod by the
         sun, <br>
         Let my soul with their souls find place, and forget what is done
         and undone. <br>
         Thou art more than the Gods who number the days of our temporal
         breath; <br>
         For these give labour and slumber; but thou, Proserpina, death. <br>
         Therefore now at thy feet I abide for a season in silence. I
         know <br>
         I shall die as my fathers died, and sleep as they sleep; even
         so. <br>
         For the glass of the years is brittle wherein we gaze for a
         span; <br>
         A little soul for a little bears up this corpse which is
         man.Ï
         <br>
         So long I endure, no longer; and laugh not again, neither weep. <br>
         For there is no God found stronger than death; and death is a
         sleep. <br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">There</span> is an end of joy and sorrow; <br>
         Peace all day long, all night, all morrow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But never a time to laugh or weep. <br>
         The end is come of pleasant places, <br>
         The end of tender words and faces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The end of all, the poppied sleep.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         No place for sound within their hearing, <br>
         No room to hope, no time for fearing, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No lips to laugh, no lids for tears. <br>
         The old years have run out all their measure; <br>
         No chance of pain, no chance of pleasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No fragment of the broken years.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Outside of all the worlds and ages, <br>
         There where the fool is as the sage is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There where the slayer is clean of blood, <br>
         No end, no passage, no beginning, <br>
         There where the sinner leaves off sinning, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There where the good man is not good.<br>

         <br><br>
         There is not one thing with another, <br>
         But Evil saith to Good: My brother, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         My brother, I am one with thee: <br>
         They shall not strive nor cry for ever: <br>
         No man shall choose between them: never <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall this thing end and that thing be.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Wind wherein seas and stars are shaken <br>
         Shall shake them, and they shall not waken; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         None that has lain down shall arise; <br>
         The stones are sealed across their places; <br>
         One shadow is shed on all their faces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One blindness cast on all their eyes.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Sleep, is it sleep perchance that covers <br>
         Each face, as each face were his lover's? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Farewell; as men that sleep fare well. <br>
         The grave's mouth laughs unto derision <br>
         Desire and dread and dream and vision, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Delight of heaven and sorrow of hell.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         No soul shall tell nor lip shall number <br>
         The names and tribes of you that slumber; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No memory, no memorial. <br>
         "Thou knowest"âwho shall say thou knowest? <br>
         There is none highest and none lowest: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         An end, an end, an end of all.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Good night, good sleep, good rest from sorrow <br>
         To these that shall not have good morrow; <br>
         
         <center>87<br></center>
         
         &nbsp;
         The gods be gentle to all these. <br>
         Nay, if death be not, how shall they be? <br>
         Nay, is there help in heaven? it may be <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All things and lords of things shall cease.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The stooped urn, filling, dips and flashes; <br>
         The bronzÃ¨d brims are deep in ashes; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The pale old lips of death are fed. <br>
         Shall this dust gather flesh hereafter? <br>
         Shall one shed tears or fall to laughter, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         At sight of all these poor old dead?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Nay, as thou wilt; these know not of it; <br>
         Thine eyes' strong weeping shall not profit, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy laughter shall not give thee ease; <br>
         Cry aloud, spare not, cease not crying, <br>
         Sigh, till thou cleave thy sides with sighing, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou shalt not raise up one of these.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Burnt spices flash, and burnt wine hisses, <br>
         The breathing flame's mouth curls and kisses <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The small dried rows of frankincense; <br>
         All round the sad red blossoms smoulder, <br>
         Flowers coloured like the fire, but colder, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In sign of sweet things taken hence;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, for their sake and in death's favour <br>
         Things of sweet shape and of sweet savour <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We yield them, spice and flower and wine; <br>
         Yea, costlier things than wine or spices, <br>
         
         <center>88<br></center>
         Whereof none knoweth how great the price is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And fruit that comes not of the vine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         From boy's pierced throat and girl's pierced bosom <br>
         Drips, reddening round the blood-red blossom, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The slow delicious bright soft blood, <br>
         Bathing the spices and the pyre, <br>
         Bathing the flowers and fallen fire, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Bathing the blossom by the bud.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Roses whose lips the flame has deadened <br>
         Drink till the lapping leaves are reddened <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And warm wet inner petals weep; <br>
         The flower whereof sick sleep gets leisure, <br>
         Barren of balm and purple pleasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fumes with no native steam of sleep.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Why will ye weep? what do ye weeping? <br>
         For waking folk and people sleeping, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And sands that fill and sands that fall, <br>
         The days rose-red, the poppied hours, <br>
         Blood, wine, and spice and fire and flowers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There is one end of one and all.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Shall such an one lend love or borrow? <br>
         Shall these be sorry for thy sorrow? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall these give thanks for words or breath? <br>
         Their hate is as their loving-kindness; <br>
         The frontlet of their brows is blindness, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The armlet of their arms is death.<br>
          
         
         <center>89<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Lo, for no noise or light of thunder <br>
         Shall these grave-clothes be rent in sunder; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         He that hath taken, shall he give? <br>
         He hath rent them: shall he bind together? <br>
         He hath bound them: shall he break the tether? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         He hath slain them: shall he bid them live?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         A little sorrow, a little pleasure, <br>
         Fate metes us from the dusty measure <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That holds the date of all of us; <br>
         We are born with travail and strong crying, <br>
         And from the birth-day to the dying <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The likeness of our life is thus.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         One girds himself to serve another, <br>
         Whose father was the dust, whose mother <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The little dead red worm therein; <br>
         They find no fruit of things they cherish; <br>
         The goodness of a man shall perish, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         It shall be one thing with his sin.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In deep wet ways by grey old gardens <br>
         Fed with sharp spring the sweet fruit hardens; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         They know not what fruits wane or grow; <br>
         Red summer burns to the utmost ember; <br>
         They know not, neither can remember, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The old years and flowers they used to know.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah, for their sakes, so trapped and taken, <br>
         For theirs, forgotten and forsaken, <br>
         
         <center>90<br></center>
         
         &nbsp;
         Watch, sleep not, gird thyself with prayer. <br>
         Nay, where the heart of wrath is broken, <br>
         Where long love ends as a thing spoken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         How shall thy crying enter there?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Though the iron sides of the old world falter <br>
         The likeness of them shall not alter <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For all the rumour of periods, <br>
         The stars and seasons that come after, <br>
         The tears of latter men, the laughter <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of the old unalterable gods.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Far up above the years and nations, <br>
         The high gods, clothed and crowned with patience, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Endure through days of deathlike date; <br>
         They bear the witness of things hidden; <br>
         Before their eyes all life stands chidden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As they before the eyes of Fate.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Not for their love shall Fate retire, <br>
         Nor they relent for our desire, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor the graves open for their call. <br>
         The end is more than joy and anguish, <br>
         Than lives that laugh and lives that languish, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The poppied sleep, the end of all. <br>

         Sex to sweet sex with lips and limbs is wed, <br>
         Turning the fruitful feud of hers and his <br>
         To the waste wedlock of a sterile kiss; <br>
         
         <center>92<br></center>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yet from them something like as fire is shed <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That shall not be assuaged till death be dead, <br>
         Though neither life nor sleep can find out this.<br>
         Love made himself of flesh that perisheth <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A pleasure-house for all the loves his kin; <br>
         But on the one side sat a man like death, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And on the other a woman sat like sin. <br>
         So with veiled eyes and sobs between his breath <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Love turned himself and would not enter in.<br>

         Love, is it love or sleep or shadow or light <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That lies between thine eyelids and thine eyes? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Like a flower laid upon a flower it lies, <br>
         Or like the night's dew laid upon the night. <br>
         Love stands upon thy left hand and thy right, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yet by no sunset and by no moonrise <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall make thee man and ease a woman's sighs, <br>
         Or make thee woman for a man's delight. <br>
         To what strange end hath some strange god made fair <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The double blossom of two fruitless flowers? <br>
         Hid love in all the folds of all thy hair, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fed thee on summers, watered thee with showers, <br>
         Given all the gold that all the seasons wear <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To thee that art a thing of barren hours?<br>

         Yea, love, I see; it is not love but fear. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nay, sweet, it is not fear but love, I know; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or wherefore should thy body's blossom blow <br>
         So sweetly, or thine eyelids leave so clear <br>
         Thy gracious eyes that never made a tearâ<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though for their love our tears like blood should
         flow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though love and life and death should come and go, <br>
         So dreadful, so desirable, so dear?<br>
         Yea, sweet, I know; I saw in what swift wise <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Beneath the woman's and the water's kiss <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy moist limbs melted into Salmacis, <br>
         And the large light turned tender in thine eyes, <br>
         And all thy boy's breath softened into sighs; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But Love being blind, how should he know of this?<br>

         Wait, and we hear not on earth if their feet<br>

         Rise, and the night wax loud with their wings;<br>
         Dumb, without word or shadow of sound;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And sift in scales and winnow as wheat<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Men's souls, and sorrow of manifold things.<br>

         Nor less of grief than ours<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The gods wrought long ago<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To bruise men one by one;<br>
         But with the incessant hours<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fresh grief and greener woe<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Spring, as the sudden sun<br>
         Year after year makes flowers;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And these die down and grow,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the next year lacks none.<br>

         As these men sleep, have slept<br>

         The old heroes in time fled,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         No dream-divided sleep;<br>
         And holier eyes have wept<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than ours, when on her dead<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Gods have seen Thetis weep,<br>
         With heavenly hair far-swept<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Back, heavenly hands outspread<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;

         Could not one day withhold,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One night; and like as these<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         White ashes of no weight,<br>
         Held not his urn the cold<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ashes of Heracles?<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For all things born one gate<br>
         Opens, no gate of gold;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Opens; and no man sees<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Beyond the gods and fate.<br>

         Clear apple-leaves are soft upon that moon <br>

         Nay take it then, my flower, my first in June, <br>
         My rose, so like a tender mouth it is: <br>

         Pluck thy red pleasure from the teeth of pain, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Break down thy vine ere yet grape-gatherers prune, <br>
         Slay me ere day can slay desire again; <br>

         Rang cracked and thin, <br>

         Far down, Faustine,<br>

         A shadow of laughter like a sigh, <br>

         Dead sorrow's kin; <br>
         So rang, thrown down, the devil's die <br>

         That won Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         A suckling of his breed you were, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One hard to wean; <br>
         But God, who lost you, left you fair, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We see, Faustine.<br>
         
         
         <center>124<br></center>
         <br><br>
         You have the face that suits a woman <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For her soul's screenâ <br>
         The sort of beauty that's called human <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In hell, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         You could do all things but be good <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or chaste of mien; <br>
         And that you would not if you could, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We know, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Even he who cast seven devils out <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of Magdalene <br>
         Could hardly do as much, I doubt, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For you, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Did Satan make you to spite God? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or did God mean <br>
         To scourge with scorpions for a rod <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our sins, Faustine?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I know what queen at first you were, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As though I had seen <br>
         Red gold and black imperious hair <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Twice crown Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         As if your fed sarcophagus <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Spared flesh and skin, <br>
         You come back face to face with us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The same Faustine.<br>
         
         
         <center>125<br></center>
         <br><br>
         She loved the games men played with death, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where death must win; <br>
         As though the slain man's blood and breath <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Revived Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Nets caught the pike, pikes tore the net; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lithe limbs and lean <br>
         From drained-out pores dripped thick red sweat <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To soothe Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She drank the steaming drift and dust <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Blown off the scene; <br>
         Blood could not ease the bitter lust <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That galled Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All round the foul fat furrows reeked, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where blood sank in; <br>
         The circus splashed and seethed and shrieked <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All round Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But these are gone now: years entomb <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The dust and din; <br>
         Yea, even the bath's fierce reek and fume <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That slew Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Was life worth living then? and now <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is life worth sin? <br>
         Where are the imperial years? and how <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Are you Faustine?<br>
         
         
         <center>126<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Your soul forgot her joys, forgot <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her times of teen; <br>
         Yea, this life likewise will you not <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Forget, Faustine?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For in the time we know not of <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Did fate begin <br>
         Weaving the web of days that wove <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Your doom, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The threads were wet with wine, and all <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Were smooth to spin; <br>
         They wove you like a Bacchanal, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The first Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And Bacchus cast your mates and you <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wild grapes to glean; <br>
         Your flower-like lips were dashed with dew <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From his, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Your drenched loose hands were stretched to hold <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The vine's wet green, <br>
         Long ere they coined in Roman gold <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Your face, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then after change of soaring feather <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And winnowing fin, <br>
         You woke in weeks of feverish weather, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A new Faustine.<br>
         
         
         <center>127<br></center>
         <br><br>
         A star upon your birthday burned, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Whose fierce serene <br>
         Red pulseless planet never yearned <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In heaven, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Stray breaths of Sapphic song that blew <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Through Mitylene <br>
         Shook the fierce quivering blood in you <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         By night, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The shameless nameless love that makes <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Hell's iron gin <br>
         Shut on you like a trap that breaks <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The soul, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And when your veins were void and dead, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What ghosts unclean <br>
         Swarmed round the straitened barren bed <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That hid Faustine?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         What sterile growths of sexless root <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or epicene? <br>
         What flower of kisses without fruit <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of love, Faustine?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         What adders came to shed their coats? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What coiled obscene <br>
         Small serpents with soft stretching throats <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Caressed Faustine?<br>
         
         
         <center>128<br></center>
         <br><br>
         But the time came of famished hours, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Maimed loves and mean, <br>
         This ghastly thin-faced time of ours, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To spoil Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         You seem a thing that hinges hold, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A love-machine <br>
         With clockwork joints of supple goldâ <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No more, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Not godless, for you serve one God, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The Lampsacene, <br>
         Who metes the gardens with his rod; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Your lord, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         If one should love you with real love <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         (Such things have been, <br>
         Things your fair face knows nothing of, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         It seems, Faustine);<br>
         
         <br><br>
         That clear hair heavily bound back, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The lights wherein <br>
         Shift from dead blue to burnt-up black; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Your throat, Faustine,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Strong, heavy, throwing out the face <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And hard bright chin <br>
         And shameful scornful lips that grace <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Their shame, Faustine,<br>
         
         
         <center>129<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Curled lips, long since half kissed away, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Still sweet and keen; <br>
         You'd give himâpoison shall we say? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or what, Faustine? <br>

         Painted with red blood on a ground of gold <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Passing between the young men and the old, <br>
         And by him Pain, whose body shone like fire, <br>
         And Pleasure with gaunt hands that grasped their hire. <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Of his left wrist, with fingers clenched and cold, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The insatiable Satiety kept hold, <br>
         Walking with feet unshod that pashed the mire. <br>
         The senses and the sorrows and the sins, <br>

         And the strange loves that suck the breasts of Hate <br>

         Death stood aloof behind a gaping grate, <br>

         Come back, true love, to comfort me. <br>

         As roses, when the warm West blows, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Break to full flower and sweeten spring, <br>
         My soul would break to a glorious rose <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In such wise at his whispering. <br>
         In vain I listen; wellaway! <br>
         My love says nothing any day.<br>

         You that will weep for pity of love <br>

         On the low place where I am lain, <br>
         I pray you, having wept enough, <br>

         Tell him for whom I bore such pain <br>
         That he was yet, ah! wellaway! <br>

         Whatever comes with years. <br>
         We twain shall not remeasure <br>

         The ways that left us twain; <br>

         Time found our tired love sleeping, <br>

         Though light love sleep to death? <br>

         We have drained his lips at leisure, <br>

         Till there's not left to drain <br>
         A single sob of pleasure, <br>

         A single pulse of pain.<br>

         Dream that the lips once breathless <br>

         Might quicken if they would; <br>
         Say that the soul is deathless; <br>

         Dream that the gods are good; <br>
         Say March may wed September, <br>

         And time divorce regret; <br>

         We have heard from hidden places <br>

         What love scarce lives and hears: <br>
         We have seen on fervent faces <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The pallor of strange tears: <br>
         We have trod the wine-vat's treasure, <br>

         Whence, ripe to steam and stain, <br>
         Foams round the feet of pleasure <br>

         The blood-red must of pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Remembrance may recover <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And time bring back to time <br>
         The name of your first lover, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The ring of my first rhyme; <br>
         But rose-leaves of December <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The frosts of June shall fret, <br>
         
         <center>134<br></center>
         The day that you remember, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The day that I forget.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The snake that hides and hisses <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In heaven we twain have known; <br>
         The grief of cruel kisses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The joy whose mouth makes moan;<br>
         The pulse's pause and measure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where in one furtive vein <br>
         Throbs through the heart of pleasure <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The purpler blood of pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We have done with tears and treasons <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And love for treason's sake; <br>
         Room for the swift new seasons, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The years that burn and break, <br>
         Dismantle and dismember <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Men's days and dreams, Juliette; <br>
         For love may not remember, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But time will not forget.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Life treads down love in flying, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Time withers him at root; <br>
         Bring all dead things and dying, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Reaped sheaf and ruined fruit, <br>
         Where, crushed by three days' pressure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our three days' love lies slain; <br>
         And earlier leaf of pleasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And latter flower of pain.<br>
         
         
         <center>135<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Breathe close upon the ashes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         It may be flame will leap; <br>
         Unclose the soft close lashes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lift up the lids, and weep. <br>
         Light love's extinguished ember, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Let one tear leave it wet <br>
         For one that you remember <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And ten that you forget. <br>

         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">When</span> the game began between them for a jest, <br>
         He played king and she played queen to match the best; <br>
         Laughter soft as tears, and tears that turned to laughter, <br>
         These were things she sought for years and sorrowed after.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Pleasure with dry lips, and pain that walks by night; <br>
         All the sting and all the stain of long delight; <br>
         These were things she knew not of, that knew not of her, <br>
         When she played at half a love with half a lover.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Time was chorus, gave them cues to laugh or cry; <br>
         They would kill, befool, amuse him, let him die; <br>
         Set him webs to weave to-day and break to-morrow, <br>
         Till he died for good in play, and rose in sorrow.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         What the years mean; how time dies and is not slain; <br>
         How love grows and laughs and cries and wanes again; <br>
         These were things she came to know, and take their measure, <br>
         When the play was played out so for one man's pleasure. <br>

         <h3>THE LEPER.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Nothing</span> is better, I well think, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than love; the hidden well-water <br>
         Is not so delicate to drink: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This was well seen of me and her.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I served her in a royal house; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I served her wine and curious meat. <br>
         For will to kiss between her brows <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I had no heart to sleep or eat.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Mere scorn God knows she had of me; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A poor scribe, nowise great or fair, <br>
         Who plucked his clerk's hood back to see <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her curled-up lips and amorous hair.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I vex my head with thinking this. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yea, though God always hated me, <br>
         And hates me now that I can kiss <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her eyes, plait up her hair to see<br>
         
         
         <center>138<br></center>
         <br><br>
         How she then wore it on the brows, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yet am I glad to have her dead <br>
         Here in this wretched wattled house <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where I can kiss her eyes and head.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Nothing is better, I well know, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than love; no amber in cold sea <br>
         Or gathered berries under snow: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That is well seen of her and me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Three thoughts I make my pleasure of: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         First I take heart and think of this: <br>
         That knight's gold hair she chose to love, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         His mouth she had such will to kiss.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then I remember that sundawn <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I brought him by a privy way <br>
         Out at her lattice, and thereon <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What gracious words she found to say.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         (Cold rushes for such little feetâ <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Both feet could lie into my hand. <br>
         A marvel was it of my sweet <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her upright body could so stand.)<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "Sweet friend, God give you thank and grace; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Now am I clean and whole of shame, <br>
         Nor shall men burn me in the face <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For my sweet fault that scandals them."<br>
         
         
         <center>139<br></center>
         <br><br>
         I tell you over word by word. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She, sitting edgewise on her bed, <br>
         Holding her feet, said thus. The third, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A sweeter thing than these, I said.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         God, that makes time and ruins it, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And alters not, abiding God, <br>
         Changed with disease her body sweet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The body of love wherein she abode.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Love is more sweet and comelier <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than a dove's throat strained out to sing. <br>
         All they spat out and cursed at her <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And cast her forth for a base thing.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They cursed her, seeing how God had wrought <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This curse to plague her, a curse of his. <br>
         Fools were they surely, seeing not <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         How sweeter than all sweet she is.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         He that had held her by the hair, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With kissing lips blinding her eyes, <br>
         Felt her bright bosom, strained and bare, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sigh under him, with short mad cries<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Out of her throat and sobbing mouth <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And body broken up with love, <br>
         With sweet hot tears his lips were loth <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her own should taste the savour of,<br>
         
         
         <center>140<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Yea, he inside whose grasp all night <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her fervent body leapt or lay, <br>
         Stained with sharp kisses red and white, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Found her a plague to spurn away.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I hid her in this wattled house, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I served her water and poor bread. <br>
         For joy to kiss between her brows <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Time upon time I was nigh dead.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Bread failed; we got but well-water <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And gathered grass with dropping seed. <br>
         I had such joy of kissing her, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I had small care to sleep or feed.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Sometimes when service made me glad <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The sharp tears leapt between my lids, <br>
         Falling on her, such joy I had <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To do the service God forbids.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "I pray you let me be at peace, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Get hence, make room for me to die." <br>
         She said that: her poor lip would cease, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Put up to mine, and turn to cry.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I said, "Bethink yourself how love <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fared in us twain, what either did; <br>
         Shall I unclothe my soul thereof? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That I should do this, God forbid."<br>
         
         
         <center>141<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Yea, though God hateth us, he knows <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That hardly in a little thing <br>
         Love faileth of the work it does <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till it grow ripe for gathering.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Six months, and now my sweet is dead <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A trouble takes me; I know not <br>
         If all were done well, all well said, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No word or tender deed forgot.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Too sweet, for the least part in her, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To have shed life out by fragments; yet, <br>
         Could the close mouth catch breath and stir, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I might see something I forget.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Six months, and I sit still and hold <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In two cold palms her cold two feet. <br>
         Her hair, half grey half ruined gold, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thrills me and burns me in kissing it.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Love bites and stings me through, to see <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her keen face made of sunken bones. <br>
         Her worn-off eyelids madden me, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That were shot through with purple once.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She said, "Be good with me; I grow <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         So tired for shame's sake, I shall die <br>
         If you say nothing:" even so. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And she is dead now, and shame put by.<br>
         
         
         <center>142<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Yea, and the scorn she had of me <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the old time, doubtless vexed her then. <br>
         I never should have kissed her. See <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What fools God's anger makes of men!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She might have loved me a little too, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Had I been humbler for her sake. <br>
         But that new shame could make love new <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She saw notâyet her shame did make.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I took too much upon my love, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Having for such mean service done <br>
         Her beauty and all the ways thereof, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her face and all the sweet thereon.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, all this while I tended her, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I know the old love held fast his part: <br>
         I know the old scorn waxed heavier, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Mixed with sad wonder, in her heart.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         It may be all my love went wrongâ <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A scribe's work writ awry and blurred, <br>
         Scrawled after the blind evensongâ <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Spoilt music with no perfect word.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But surely I would fain have done <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All things the best I could. Perchance <br>
         Because I failed, came short of one, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She kept at heart that other man's.<br>
         
         
         <center>143<br></center>
         <br><br>
         I am grown blind with all these things: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         It may be now she hath in sight <br>
         Some better knowledge; still there clings <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The old question. Will not God do right? *
         <br>

          En ce temps-lÃ  estoyt dans ce pays grand nombre de ladres et de

         en estre moult griefvement courroucÃ©. Ores il advint qu'une

         <h3>A BALLAD OF BURDENS.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">The</span> burden of fair women. Vain delight,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And love self-slain in some sweet shameful way,<br>
         And sorrowful old age that comes by night<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As a thief comes that has no heart by day,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And change that finds fair cheeks and leaves them
         grey,<br>
         And weariness that keeps awake for hire,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And grief that says what pleasure used to say;<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The burden of bought kisses. This is sore,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A burden without fruit in childbearing;<br>
         Between the nightfall and the dawn threescore,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Threescore between the dawn and evening.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The shuddering in thy lips, the shuddering<br>
         In thy sad eyelids tremulous like fire,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Makes love seem shameful and a wretched thing.<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         
         <center>145<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The burden of sweet speeches. Nay, kneel down,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Cover thy head, and weep; for verily<br>
         These market-men that buy thy white and brown<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the last days shall take no thought for thee.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the last days like earth thy face shall be,<br>
         Yea, like sea-marsh made thick with brine and mire,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sad with sick leavings of the sterile sea.<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The burden of long living. Thou shalt fear<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Waking, and sleeping mourn upon thy bed;<br>
         And say at night "Would God the day were here,"<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And say at dawn "Would God the day were dead."<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With weary days thou shalt be clothed and fed,<br>
         And wear remorse of heart for thine attire,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Pain for thy girdle and sorrow upon thine head;<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The burden of bright colours. Thou shalt see<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Gold tarnished, and the grey above the green;<br>
         And as the thing thou seest thy face shall be,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And no more as the thing beforetime seen.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And thou shalt say of mercy "It hath been,"<br>
         And living, watch the old lips and loves expire,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And talking, tears shall take thy breath between;<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The burden of sad sayings. In that day<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou shalt tell all thy days and hours, and tell<br>
         
         <center>146<br></center>
         Thy times and ways and words of love, and say<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         How one was dear and one desirable,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And sweet was life to hear and sweet to smell,<br>
         But now with lights reverse the old hours retire<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the last hour is shod with fire from hell;<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The burden of fair seasons. Rain in spring,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         White rain and wind among the tender trees;<br>
         A summer of green sorrows gathering,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Rank autumn in a mist of miseries,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With sad face set towards the year, that sees<br>
         The charred ash drop out of the dropping pyre,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And winter wan with many maladies;<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The burden of dead faces. Out of sight<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And out of love, beyond the reach of hands,<br>
         Changed in the changing of the dark and light,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         They walk and weep about the barren lands<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where no seed is nor any garner stands,<br>
         Where in short breaths the doubtful days respire,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And time's turned glass lets through the sighing
         sands;<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The burden of much gladness. Life and lust<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Forsake thee, and the face of thy delight;<br>
         And underfoot the heavy hour strews dust,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And overhead strange weathers burn and bite;<br>
         
         <center>147<br></center>
         
         &nbsp;
         And where the red was, lo the bloodless white,<br>
         And where truth was, the likeness of a liar,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And where day was, the likeness of the night;<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>

         For life is sweet, but after life is death.<br>

         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Freedom and spring.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The sweet land laughs from sea to sea,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Filled full of sun;<br>
         All things come back to her, being free;<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         All things but one.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In many a tender wheaten plot<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Flowers that were dead<br>
         Live, and old suns revive; but not<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That holier head.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         By this white wandering waste of sea,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Far north, I hear<br>
         One face shall never turn to me<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As once this year:<br>
         
         
         <center>156<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Shall never smile and turn and rest<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         On mine as there,<br>
         Nor one most sacred hand be prest<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Upon my hair.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I came as one whose thoughts half linger,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Half run before;<br>
         The youngest to the oldest singer<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That England bore.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I found him whom I shall not find<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Till all grief end,<br>
         In holiest age our mightiest mind,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Father and friend.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But thou, if anything endure,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         If hope there be,<br>
         O spirit that man's life left pure,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Man's death set free,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Not with disdain of days that were<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Look earthward now;<br>
         Let dreams revive the reverend hair,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The imperial brow;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Come back in sleep, for in the life<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Where thou art not<br>
         We find none like thee. Time and strife<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the world's lot<br>
         
         
         <center>157<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Move thee no more; but love at least<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And reverent heart<br>
         May move thee, royal and released,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Soul, as thou art.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And thou, his Florence, to thy trust<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Receive and keep,<br>
         Keep safe his dedicated dust,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         His sacred sleep.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         So shall thy lovers, come from far,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Mix with thy name<br>
         As morning-star with evening-star<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         His faultless fame.<br>

         <h3>A SONG IN TIME OF ORDER. 1852.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Push</span> hard across the sand, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For the salt wind gathers breath; <br>
         Shoulder and wrist and hand, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Push hard as the push of death.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The wind is as iron that rings, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The foam-heads loosen and flee; <br>
         It swells and welters and swings, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The pulse of the tide of the sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And up on the yellow cliff <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The long corn flickers and shakes; <br>
         Push, for the wind holds stiff, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the gunwale dips and rakes.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Good hap to the fresh fierce weather, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The quiver and beat of the sea! <br>
         While three men hold together, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The kingdoms are less by three.<br>
         
         
         <center>159<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Out to the sea with her there, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Out with her over the sand; <br>
         Let the kings keep the earth for their share! <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         We have done with the sharers of land.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They have tied the world in a tether, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         They have bought over God with a fee; <br>
         While three men hold together, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The kingdoms are less by three.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We have done with the kisses that sting, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The thief's mouth red from the feast, <br>
         The blood on the hands of the king <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the lie at the lips of the priest.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Will they tie the winds in a tether, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Put a bit in the jaws of the sea? <br>
         While three men hold together, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The kingdoms are less by three.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let our flag run out straight in the wind! <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The old red shall be floated again <br>
         When the ranks that are thin shall be thinned, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         When the names that were twenty are ten;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         When the devil's riddle is mastered <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the galley-bench creaks with a Pope, <br>
         We shall see Buonaparte the bastard <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Kick heels with his throat in a rope.<br>
         
         
         <center>160<br></center>
         <br><br>
         While the shepherd sets wolves on his sheep <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the emperor halters his kine, <br>
         While Shame is a watchman asleep <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And Faith is a keeper of swine,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let the wind shake our flag like a feather, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Like the plumes of the foam of the sea! <br>
         While three men hold together, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The kingdoms are less by three.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All the world has its burdens to bear, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         From Cayenne to the Austrian whips; <br>
         Forth, with the rain in our hair <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the salt sweet foam in our lips;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In the teeth of the hard glad weather, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         In the blown wet face of the sea; <br>
         While three men hold together, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The kingdoms are less by three. <br>

         <h3>A SONG IN TIME OF REVOLUTION. 1860.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">The</span> heart of the rulers is sick, and the high-priest covers
         his head: <br>
         For this is the song of the quick that is heard in the ears of the
         dead.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The poor and the halt and the blind are keen and mighty and fleet: <br>
         Like the noise of the blowing of wind is the sound of the noise of
         their feet.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The wind has the sound of a laugh in the clamour of days and of
         deeds: <br>
         The priests are scattered like chaff, and the rulers broken like
         reeds.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The high-priest sick from qualms, with his raiment bloodily
         dashed; <br>
         The thief with branded palms, and the liar with cheeks
         abashed.<br>
         
         
         <center>162<br></center>
         <br><br>
         They are smitten, they tremble greatly, they are pained for their
         pleasant things; <br>
         For the house of the priests made stately, and the might in the
         mouth of the kings.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They are grieved and greatly afraid; they are taken, they shall
         not flee: <br>
         For the heart of the nations is made as the strength of the
         springs of the sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They were fair in the grace of gold, they walked with delicate
         feet: <br>
         They were clothed with the cunning of old, and the smell of their
         garments was sweet.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For the breaking of gold in their hair they halt as a man made
         lame: <br>
         They are utterly naked and bare; their mouths are bitter with
         shame.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Wilt thou judge thy people now, O king that wast found most wise? <br>
         Wilt thou lie any more, O thou whose mouth is emptied of
         lies?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Shall God make a pact with thee, till his hook be found in thy
         sides? <br>
         Wilt thou put back the time of the sea, or the place of the
         season of tides?<br>
         
         
         <center>163<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Set a word in thy lips, to stand before God with a word in thy
         mouth; <br>
         That "the rain shall return in the land, and the tender dew after
         drouth."<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But the arm of the elders is broken, their strength is unbound
         and undone: <br>
         They wait for a sign of a token; they cry, and there cometh
         none.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Their moan is in every place, the cry of them filleth the land: <br>
         There is shame in the sight of their face, there is fear in the
         thews of their hand.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They are girdled about the reins with a curse for the girdle
         thereon: <br>
         For the noise of the rending of chains the face of their colour
         is gone.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For the sound of the shouting of men they are grievously stricken
         at heart: <br>
         They are smitten asunder with pain, their bones are smitten
         apart.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There is none of them all that is whole; their lips gape open for
         breath; <br>
         They are clothed with sickness of soul, and the shape of the
         shadow of death.<br>
         
         <center>164<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The wind is thwart in their feet; it is full of the shouting of
         mirth; <br>
         As one shaketh the sides of a sheet, so it shaketh the ends of
         the earth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The sword, the sword is made keen; the iron has opened its mouth; <br>
         The corn is red that was green; it is bound for the sheaves of
         the south.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The sound of a word was shed, the sound of the wind as a breath, <br>
         In the ears of the souls that were dead, in the dust of the
         deepness of death;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Where the face of the moon is taken, the ways of the stars
         undone, <br>
         The light of the whole sky shaken, the light of the face of the
         sun:<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Where the waters are emptied and broken, the waves of the waters
         are stayed; <br>
         Where God has bound for a token the darkness that maketh
         afraid;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Where the sword was covered and hidden, and dust had grown in its
         side, <br>
         A word came forth which was bidden, the crying of one that
         cried:<br>
         
         <center>165<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The sides of the two-edged sword shall be bare, and its mouth
         shall be red, <br>
         For the breath of the face of the Lord that is felt in the bones
         of the dead. <br>

         God's lightning spared, they said, <br>

         Alone the happier head <br>
         Whose laurels screened it; fruitless grace for thee, <br>

         And only loosed on slaves and kings <br>
         The terror of the tempest of their wings.<br>

         Thou sawest the tides of things <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Close over heads of kings, <br>
         And thine hand felt the thunder, and to thee <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Laurels and lightnings were <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As sunbeams and soft air <br>
         Mixed each in other, or as mist with sea <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Mixed, or as memory with desire, <br>
         Or the lute's pulses with the louder lyre.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For thee man's spirit stood <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Disrobed of flesh and blood, <br>
         And bare the heart of the most secret hours; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And to thine hand more tame <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Than birds in winter came <br>
         High hopes and unknown flying forms of powers, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And from thy table fed, and sang <br>
         Till with the tune men's ears took fire and rang.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Even all men's eyes and ears <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With fiery sound and tears <br>
         Waxed hot, and cheeks caught flame and eyelids light, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         At those high songs of thine <br>
         
         <center>168<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That stung the sense like wine, <br>
         Or fell more soft than dew or snow by night, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Or wailed as in some flooded cave <br>
         Sobs the strong broken spirit of a wave.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But we, our master, we <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whose hearts, uplift to thee,<br>
         Ache with the pulse of thy remembered song, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         We ask not nor await <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         From the clenched hands of fate, <br>
         As thou, remission of the world's old wrong; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Respite we ask not, nor release; <br>
         Freedom a man may have, he shall not peace.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Though thy most fiery hope <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Storm heaven, to set wide ope <br>
         The all-sought-for gate whence God or Chance debars <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         All feet of men, all eyesâ <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The old night resumes her skies, <br>
         Her hollow hiding-place of clouds and stars, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Where nought save these is sure in sight; <br>
         And, paven with death, our days are roofed with night.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         One thing we can; to be <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Awhile, as men may, free; <br>
         But not by hope or pleasure the most stern <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Goddess, most awful-eyed, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Sits, but on either side <br>
         Sit sorrow and the wrath of hearts that burn, <br>
         
         <center>169<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Sad faith that cannot hope or fear, <br>
         And memory grey with many a flowerless year.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Not that in stranger's wise <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         I lift not loving eyes <br>
         To the fair foster-mother France, that gave <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Beyond the pale fleet foam <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Help to my sires and home, <br>
         Whose great sweet breast could shelter those and save<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whom from her nursing breasts and hands <br>
         Their land cast forth of old on gentler lands.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Not without thoughts that ache <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For theirs and for thy sake, <br>
         I, born of exiles, hail thy banished head; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         I whose young song took flight <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Toward the great heat and light <br>
         On me a child from thy far splendour shed, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         From thine high place of soul and song, <br>
         Which, fallen on eyes yet feeble, made them strong.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Ah, not with lessening love <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For memories born hereof, <br>
         I look to that sweet mother-land, and see <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The old fields and fair full streams, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And skies, but fled like dreams <br>
         The feet of freedom and the thought of thee; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And all between the skies and graves <br>
         The mirth of mockers and the shame of slaves.<br>
         
         
         <center>170<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         She, killed with noisome air, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Even she! and still so fair, <br>
         Who said "Let there be freedom," and there was <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Freedom; and as a lance <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The fiery eyes of France <br>
         Touched the world's sleep and as a sleep made pass <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Forth of men's heavier ears and eyes <br>
         Smitten with fire and thunder from new skies.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Are they men's friends indeed <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Who watch them weep and bleed? <br>
         Because thou hast loved us, shall the gods love thee?<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thou, first of men and friend, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Seest thou, even thou, the end? <br>
         Thou knowest what hath been, knowest thou what shall be? <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Evils may pass and hopes endure; <br>
         But fate is dim, and all the gods obscure.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         O nursed in airs apart, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         O poet highest of heart, <br>
         Hast thou seen time, who hast seen so many things? <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Are not the years more wise, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         More sad than keenest eyes, <br>
         The years with soundless feet and sounding wings? <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Passing we hear them not, but past <br>
         The clamour of them thrills us, and their blast.<br>
         
         <center>171<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thou art chief of us, and lord; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thy song is as a sword <br>
         Keen-edged and scented in the blade from flowers; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thou art lord and king; but we <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Lift younger eyes, and see <br>
         Less of high hope, less light on wandering hours; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Hours that have borne men down so long, <br>
         Seen the right fail, and watched uplift the wrong.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But thine imperial soul, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As years and ruins roll <br>
         To the same end, and all things and all dreams <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With the same wreck and roar <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Drift on the dim same shore, <br>
         Still in the bitter foam and brackish streams <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Tracks the fresh water-spring to be <br>
         And sudden sweeter fountains in the sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As once the high God bound <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With many a rivet round <br>
         Man's saviour, and with iron nailed him through, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         At the wild end of things, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Where even his own bird's wings <br>
         Flagged, whence the sea shone like a drop of dew, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         From Caucasus beheld below <br>
         Past fathoms of unfathomable snow;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         So the strong God, the chance <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Central of circumstance, <br>
         
         <center>172<br></center>
         Still shows him exile who will not be slave; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         All thy great fame and thee <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Girt by the dim strait sea <br>
         With multitudinous walls of wandering wave; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Shows us our greatest from his throne <br>
         Fate-stricken, and rejected of his own.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Yea, he is strong, thou say'st, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         A mystery many-faced, <br>
         The wild beasts know him and the wild birds flee; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The blind night sees him, death <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Shrinks beaten at his breath, <br>
         And his right hand is heavy on the sea: <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         We know he hath made us, and is king; <br>
         We know not if he care for anything.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thus much, no more, we know; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         He bade what is be so, <br>
         Bade light be and bade night be, one by one; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Bade hope and fear, bade ill <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And good redeem and kill, <br>
         Till all men be aweary of the sun <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And his world burn in its own flame <br>
         And bear no witness longer of his name.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Yet though all this be thus, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Be those men praised of us <br>
         Who have loved and wrought and sorrowed and not sinned <br>
         
         <center>173<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For fame or fear or gold, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Nor waxed for winter cold, <br>
         Nor changed for changes of the worldly wind; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Praised above men of men be these, <br>
         Till this one world and work we know shall cease.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Yea, one thing more than this, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         We know that one thing is, <br>
         The splendour of a spirit without blame, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That not the labouring years <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Blind-born, nor any fears, <br>
         Nor men nor any gods can tire or tame; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But purer power with fiery breath <br>
         Fills, and exalts above the gulfs of death.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Praised above men be thou, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whose laurel-laden brow, <br>
         Made for the morning, droops not in the night; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Praised and beloved, that none <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Of all thy great things done <br>
         Flies higher than thy most equal spirit's flight; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Praised, that nor doubt nor hope could bend <br>
         Earth's loftiest head, found upright to the end. <br>

         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Sweet</span> life, if life were stronger, <br>
         Earth clear of years that wrong her, <br>
         Then two things might live longer, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Two sweeter things than they; <br>
         Delight, the rootless flower, <br>
         And love, the bloomless bower; <br>
         Delight that lives an hour, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And love that lives a day.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         From evensong to daytime, <br>
         When April melts in Maytime, <br>
         Love lengthens out his playtime, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Love lessens breath by breath, <br>
         And kiss by kiss grows older <br>
         On listless throat or shoulder <br>
         Turned sideways now, turned colder <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than life that dreams of death.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         This one thing once worth giving <br>
         Life gave, and seemed worth living; <br>
         
         <center>175<br></center>
         Sin sweet beyond forgiving <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And brief beyond regret: <br>
         To laugh and love together <br>
         And weave with foam and feather <br>
         And wind and words the tether <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our memories play with yet.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah, one thing worth beginning, <br>
         One thread in life worth spinning, <br>
         Ah sweet, one sin worth sinning <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With all the whole soul's will; <br>
         To lull you till one stilled you, <br>
         To kiss you till one killed you, <br>
         To feed you till one filled you, <br>

         Sweet lips, if love could fill;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         To hunt sweet Love and lose him <br>
         Between white arms and bosom, <br>
         Between the bud and blossom, <br>

         Between your throat and chin; <br>
         To say of shameâwhat is it? <br>
         Of virtueâwe can miss it; <br>
         Of sinâwe can but kiss it, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And it's no longer sin:<br>
         
         <br><br>
         To feel the strong soul, stricken <br>
         Through fleshly pulses, quicken <br>
         Beneath swift sighs that thicken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Soft hands and lips that smite; <br>
         
         <center>176<br></center>Lips that no love can tire, <br>
         With hands that sting like fire, <br>
         Weaving the web Desire <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To snare the bird Delight.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But love so lightly plighted, <br>
         Our love with torch unlighted, <br>
         Paused near us unaffrighted, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who found and left him free; <br>
         None, seeing us cloven in sunder, <br>
         Will weep or laugh or wonder; <br>
         Light love stands clear of thunder, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And safe from winds at sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         As, when late larks give warning <br>
         Of dying lights and dawning, <br>
         Night murmurs to the morning, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         "Lie still, O love, lie still;" <br>
         And half her dark limbs cover <br>
         The white limbs of her lover, <br>
         With amorous plumes that hover <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And fervent lips that chill;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         As scornful day represses <br>
         Night's void and vain caresses, <br>
         And from her cloudier tresses <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Unwinds the gold of his, <br>
         With limbs from limbs dividing <br>
         And breath by breath subsiding; <br>
         
         <center>177<br></center>
         For love has no abiding, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But dies before the kiss;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         So hath it been, so be it; <br>
         For who shall live and flee it? <br>
         But look that no man see it <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or hear it unaware; <br>
         Lest all who love and choose him <br>
         See Love, and so refuse him; <br>
         For all who find him lose him, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But all have found him fair. <br>

         <h3>DOLORES</h3>
         
         <h3>(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS.)</h3>
         <br><br>
         Cold eyelids that hide like a jewel <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Hard eyes that grow soft for an hour; <br>
         The heavy white limbs, and the cruel <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Red mouth like a venomous flower; <br>
         When these are gone by with their glories, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What shall rest of thee then, what remain, <br>
         O mystic and sombre Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Seven sorrows the priests give their Virgin; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But thy sins, which are seventy times seven, <br>
         Seven ages would fail thee to purge in, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And then they would haunt thee in heaven: <br>
         Fierce midnights and famishing morrows, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the loves that complete and control <br>
         All the joys of the flesh, all the sorrows <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That wear out the soul.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O garment not golden but gilded, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O garden where all men may dwell, <br>
         
         <center>179<br></center>
         O tower not of ivory, but builded <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         By hands that reach heaven from hell;<br>
         O mystical rose of the mire, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O house not of gold but of gain, <br>
         O house of unquenchable fire, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O lips full of lust and of laughter, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Curled snakes that are fed from my breast, <br>
         Bite hard, lest remembrance come after <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And press with new lips where you pressed. <br>
         For my heart too springs up at the pressure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Mine eyelids too moisten and burn; <br>
         Ah, feed me and fill me with pleasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ere pain come in turn.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In yesterday's reach and to-morrow's, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Out of sight though they lie of to-day, <br>
         There have been and there yet shall be sorrows <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That smite not and bite not in play. <br>
         The life and the love thou despisest, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         These hurt us indeed, and in vain, <br>
         O wise among women, and wisest, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Who gave thee thy wisdom? what stories <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That stung thee, what visions that smote? <br>
         Wert thou pure and a maiden, Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When desire took thee first by the throat? <br>
         
         <center>180<br></center>
         What bud was the shell of a blossom <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That all men may smell to and pluck? <br>
         What milk fed thee first at what bosom? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What sins gave thee suck?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We shift and bedeck and bedrape us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou art noble and nude and antique;<br>
         Libitina thy mother, Priapus <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy father, a Tuscan and Greek. <br>
         We play with light loves in the portal, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And wince and relent and refrain; <br>
         Loves die, and we know thee immortal, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Fruits fail and love dies and time ranges; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou art fed with perpetual breath, <br>
         And alive after infinite changes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And fresh from the kisses of death; <br>
         Of languors rekindled and rallied, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of barren delights and unclean, <br>
         Things monstrous and fruitless, a pallid <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And poisonous queen.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Could you hurt me, sweet lips, though I hurt you? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Men touch them, and change in a trice <br>
         The lilies and languors of virtue <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For the raptures and roses of vice; <br>
         Those lie where thy foot on the floor is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         These crown and caress thee and chain, <br>
         
         <center>181<br></center>
         O splendid and sterile Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There are sins it may be to discover, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There are deeds it may be to delight. <br>
         What new work wilt thou find for thy lover, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What new passions for daytime or night? <br>
         What spells that they know not a word of <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Whose lives are as leaves overblown? <br>
         What tortures undreamt of, unheard of, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Unwritten, unknown?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah beautiful passionate body <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That never has ached with a heart! <br>
         On thy mouth though the kisses are bloody, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though they sting till it shudder and smart, <br>
         More kind than the love we adore is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         They hurt not the heart or the brain, <br>
         O bitter and tender Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         As our kisses relax and redouble, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From the lips and the foam and the fangs <br>
         Shall no new sin be born for men's trouble, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No dream of impossible pangs? <br>
         With the sweet of the sins of old ages <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wilt thou satiate thy soul as of yore? <br>
         Too sweet is the rind, say the sages, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Too bitter the core.<br>
         
         <center>182<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Hast thou told all thy secrets the last time, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And bared all thy beauties to one? <br>
         Ah, where shall we go then for pastime, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If the worst that can be has been done? <br>
         But sweet as the rind was the core is; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We are fain of thee still, we are fain, <br>
         O sanguine and subtle Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         By the hunger of change and emotion, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         By the thirst of unbearable things, <br>
         By despair, the twin-born of devotion, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         By the pleasure that winces and stings, <br>
         The delight that consumes the desire, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The desire that outruns the delight, <br>
         By the cruelty deaf as a fire <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And blind as the night,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         By the ravenous teeth that have smitten <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Through the kisses that blossom and bud, <br>
         By the lips intertwisted and bitten <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till the foam has a savour of blood, <br>
         By the pulse as it rises and falters, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         By the hands as they slacken and strain, <br>
         I adjure thee, respond from thine altars, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Wilt thou smile as a woman disdaining <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The light fire in the veins of a boy? <br>
         
         <center>183<br></center>
         But he comes to thee sad, without feigning, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who has wearied of sorrow and joy; <br>
         Less careful of labour and glory <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than the elders whose hair has uncurled; <br>
         And young, but with fancies as hoary <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And grey as the world.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I have passed from the outermost portal <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To the shrine where a sin is a prayer; <br>
         What care though the service be mortal? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O our Lady of Torture, what care? <br>
         All thine the last wine that I pour is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The last in the chalice we drain, <br>
         O fierce and luxurious Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All thine the new wine of desire, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The fruit of four lips as they clung <br>
         Till the hair and the eyelids took fire, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The foam of a serpentine tongue, <br>
         The froth of the serpents of pleasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         More salt than the foam of the sea, <br>
         Now felt as a flame, now at leisure <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As wine shed for me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah thy people, thy children, thy chosen, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Marked cross from the womb and perverse! <br>
         They have found out the secret to cozen <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The gods that constrain us and curse; <br>
         
         <center>184<br></center>
         They alone, they are wise, and none other; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Give me place, even me, in their train, <br>
         O my sister, my spouse, and my mother, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For the crown of our life as it closes <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is darkness, the fruit thereof dust; <br>
         No thorns go as deep as a rose's, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And love is more cruel than lust. <br>
         Time turns the old days to derision, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our loves into corpses or wives; <br>
         And marriage and death and division <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Make barren our lives.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And pale from the past we draw nigh thee, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And satiate with comfortless hours; <br>
         And we know thee, how all men belie thee, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And we gather the fruit of thy flowers; <br>
         The passion that slays and recovers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The pangs and the kisses that rain <br>
         On the lips and the limbs of thy lovers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The desire of thy furious embraces <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is more than the wisdom of years, <br>
         On the blossom though blood lie in traces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though the foliage be sodden with tears. <br>
         For the lords in whose keeping the door is <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That opens on all who draw breath <br>
         
         <center>185<br></center>
         Gave the cypress to love, my Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The myrtle to death.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And they laughed, changing hands in the measure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And they mixed and made peace after strife; <br>
         Pain melted in tears, and was pleasure; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Death tingled with blood, and was life. <br>
         Like lovers they melted and tingled, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the dusk of thine innermost fane; <br>
         In the darkness they murmured and mingled, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In a twilight where virtues are vices, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In thy chapels, unknown of the sun, <br>
         To a tune that enthralls and entices, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         They were wed, and the twain were as one. <br>
         For the tune from thine altar hath sounded <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Since God bade the world's work begin, <br>
         And the fume of thine incense abounded, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To sweeten the sin.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Love listens, and paler than ashes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Through his curls as the crown on them slips, <br>
         Lifts languid wet eyelids and lashes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And laughs with insatiable lips. <br>
         Thou shalt hush him with heavy caresses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With music that scares the profane; <br>
         Thou shalt darken his eyes with thy tresses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <center>186<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Thou shalt blind his bright eyes though he wrestle, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou shalt chain his light limbs though he strive; <br>
         In his lips all thy serpents shall nestle, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In his hands all thy cruelties thrive. <br>
         In the daytime thy voice shall go through him, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In his dreams he shall feel thee and ache; <br>
         Thou shalt kindle by night and subdue him <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Asleep and awake.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Thou shalt touch and make redder his roses <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With juice not of fruit nor of bud; <br>
         When the sense in the spirit reposes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou shalt quicken the soul through the blood. <br>
         Thine, thine the one grace we implore is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who would live and not languish or feign, <br>
         O sleepless and deadly Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Dost thou dream, in a respite of slumber, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In a lull of the fires of thy life, <br>
         Of the days without name, without number, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When thy will stung the world into strife; <br>
         When, a goddess, the pulse of thy passion <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Smote kings as they revelled in Rome; <br>
         And they hailed thee re-risen, O Thalassian, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Foam-white, from the foam?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         When thy lips had such lovers to flatter; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When the city lay red from thy rods, <br>
         
         <center>187<br></center>
         And thine hands were as arrows to scatter <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The children of change and their gods; <br>
         When the blood of thy foemen made fervent <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A sand never moist from the main, <br>
         As one smote them, their lord and thy servant, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         On sands by the storm never shaken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor wet from the washing of tides; <br>
         Nor by foam of the waves overtaken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor winds that the thunder bestrides; <br>
         But red from the print of thy paces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Made smooth for the world and its lords, <br>
         Ringed round with a flame of fair faces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And splendid with swords.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There the gladiator, pale for thy pleasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Drew bitter and perilous breath; <br>
         There torments laid hold on the treasure <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of limbs too delicious for death; <br>
         When thy gardens were lit with live torches; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When the world was a steed for thy rein; <br>
         When the nations lay prone in thy porches, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         When, with flame all around him aspirant, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Stood flushed, as a harp-player stands, <br>
         The implacable beautiful tyrant, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Rose-crowned, having death in his hands; <br>
         
         <center>187<br></center>
         And a sound as the sound of loud water <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Smote far through the flight of the fires, <br>
         And mixed with the lightning of slaughter <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A thunder of lyres.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Dost thou dream of what was and no more is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The old kingdoms of earth and the kings? <br>
         Dost thou hunger for these things, Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For these, in a world of new things? <br>
         But thy bosom no fasts could emaciate, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No hunger compel to complain <br>
         Those lips that no bloodshed could satiate, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         As of old when the world's heart was lighter, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Through thy garments the grace of thee glows, <br>
         The white wealth of thy body made whiter <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         By the blushes of amorous blows, <br>
         And seamed with sharp lips and fierce fingers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And branded by kisses that bruise; <br>
         When all shall be gone that now lingers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ah, what shall we lose?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Thou wert fair in the fearless old fashion, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And thy limbs are as melodies yet, <br>
         And move to the music of passion <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With lithe and lascivious regret. <br>
         What ailed us, O gods, to desert you <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For creeds that refuse and restrain? <br>
         
         <center>189<br></center>
         Come down and redeem us from virtue, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All shrines that were Vestal are flameless, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But the flame has not fallen from this; <br>
         Though obscure be the god, and though nameless <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The eyes and the hair that we kiss; <br>
         Low fires that love sits by and forges <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fresh heads for his arrows and thine; <br>
         Hair loosened and soiled in mid orgies <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With kisses and wine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Thy skin changes country and colour, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And shrivels or swells to a snake's. <br>
         Let it brighten and bloat and grow duller, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We know it, the flames and the flakes, <br>
         Red brands on it smitten and bitten, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Round skies where a star is a stain, <br>
         And the leaves with thy litanies written, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         On thy bosom though many a kiss be, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There are none such as knew it of old. <br>
         Was it Alciphron once or Arisbe, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Male ringlets or feminine gold, <br>
         That thy lips met with under the statue, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Whence a look shot out sharp after thieves <br>
         From the eyes of the garden-god at you <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Across the fig-leaves?<br>
         
         
         <center>190<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Then still, through dry seasons and moister, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One god had a wreath to his shrine; <br>
         Then love was the pearl of his oyster, *
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And Venus rose red out of wine. <br>
         We have all done amiss, choosing rather <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Such loves as the wise gods disdain; <br>
         Intercede for us thou with thy father, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In spring he had crowns of his garden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Red corn in the heat of the year, <br>
         Then hoary green olives that harden <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When the grape-blossom freezes with fear; <br>
         And milk-budded myrtles with Venus <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And vine-leaves with Bacchus he trod; <br>
         And ye said, âWe have seen, he hath seen us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A visible God.â<br>
         
         <br><br>
         What broke off the garlands that girt you? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What sundered you spirit and clay? <br>
         Weak sins yet alive are as virtue <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To the strength of the sins of that day. <br>
         For dried is the blood of thy lover, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ipsithilla, contracted the vein; <br>
         Cry aloud, âWill he rise and recover, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain?â<br>
         
         <center>191<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Cry aloud; for the old world is broken: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Cry out; for the Phrygian is priest, <br>
         And rears not the bountiful token <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And spreads not the fatherly feast.<br>
         From the midmost of Ida, from shady <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Recesses that murmur at morn, <br>
         They have brought and baptized her, Our Lady, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A goddess new-born.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And the chaplets of old are above us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the oyster-bed teems out of reach; <br>
         Old poets outsing and outlove us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And Catullus makes mouths at our speech. <br>
         Who shall kiss, in thy father's own city, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With such lips as he sang with, again? <br>
         Intercede for us all of thy pity, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Out of Dindymus heavily laden <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her lions draw bound and unfed <br>
         A mother, a mortal, a maiden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A queen over death and the dead. <br>
         She is cold, and her habit is lowly, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her temple of branches and sods; <br>
         Most fruitful and virginal, holy, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A mother of gods.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She hath wasted with fire thine high places, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She hath hidden and marred and made sad <br>
         
         <center>192<br></center>
         The fair limbs of the Loves, the fair faces <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of gods that were goodly and glad. <br>
         She slays, and her hands are not bloody; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She moves as a moon in the wane, <br>
         White-robed, and thy raiment is ruddy, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They shall pass and their places be taken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The gods and the priests that are pure.<br>
         They shall pass, and shalt thou not be shaken? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         They shall perish, and shalt thou endure? <br>
         Death laughs, breathing close and relentless <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the nostrils and eyelids of lust, <br>
         With a pinch in his fingers of scentless <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And delicate dust.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But the worm shall revive thee with kisses; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou shalt change and transmute as a god, <br>
         As the rod to a serpent that hisses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As the serpent again to a rod. <br>
         Thy life shall not cease though thou doff it; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou shalt live until evil be slain, <br>
         And good shall die first, said thy prophet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Did he lie? did he laugh? does he know it, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Now he lies out of reach, out of breath, <br>
         Thy prophet, thy preacher, thy poet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sin's child by incestuous Death? <br>
         
         <center>193<br></center>
         Did he find out in fire at his waking, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or discern as his eyelids lost light, <br>
         When the bands of the body were breaking <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And all came in sight?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Who has known all the evil before us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or the tyrannous secrets of time? <br>
         Though we match not the dead men that bore us <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         At a song, at a kiss, at a crimeâ <br>
         Though the heathen outface and outlive us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And our lives and our longings are twainâ <br>
         Ah, forgive us our virtues, forgive us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Who are we that embalm and embrace thee <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With spices and savours of song? <br>
         What is time, that his children should face thee? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What am I, that my lips do thee wrong? <br>
         I could hurt theeâbut pain would delight thee; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or caress theeâbut love would repel; <br>
         And the lovers whose lips would excite thee <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Are serpents in hell.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Who now shall content thee as they did, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy lovers, when temples were built <br>
         And the hair of the sacrifice braided <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the blood of the sacrifice spilt, <br>
         In Lampsacus fervent with faces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In Aphaca red from thy reign, <br>
         
         <center>194<br></center>
         Who embraced thee with awful embraces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Where are they, Cotytto or Venus, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Astarte or Ashtaroth, where? <br>
         Do their hands as we touch come between us? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is the breath of them hot in thy hair? <br>
         From their lips have thy lips taken fever, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With the blood of their bodies grown red? <br>
         Hast thou left upon earth a believer <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If these men are dead?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They were purple of raiment and golden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Filled full of thee, fiery with wine, <br>
         Thy lovers, in haunts unbeholden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In marvellous chambers of thine. <br>
         They are fled, and their footprints escape us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who appraise thee, adore, and abstain, <br>
         O daughter of Death and Priapus, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         What ails us to fear overmeasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To praise thee with timorous breath, <br>
         O mistress and mother of pleasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The one thing as certain as death? <br>
         We shall change as the things that we cherish, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall fade as they faded before, <br>
         As foam upon water shall perish, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As sand upon shore.<br>
         
         <center>195<br></center>
         <br><br>
         We shall know what the darkness discovers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If the grave-pit be shallow or deep; <br>
         And our fathers of old, and our lovers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We shall know if they sleep not or sleep. <br>
         We shall see whether hell be not heaven, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Find out whether tares be not grain, <br>
         And the joys of thee seventy times seven, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain. <br>

         <h3>THE GARDEN OF PROSERPINE.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Here</span>, where the world is quiet; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Here, where all trouble seems <br>
         Dead winds' and spent waves' riot <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In doubtful dreams of dreams; <br>
         I watch the green field growing <br>
         For reaping folk and sowing, <br>
         For harvest-time and mowing, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A sleepy world of streams.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I am tired of tears and laughter, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And men that laugh and weep; <br>
         Of what may come hereafter <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For men that sow to reap: <br>
         I am weary of days and hours, <br>
         Blown buds of barren flowers, <br>
         Desires and dreams and powers <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And everything but sleep.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Here life has death for neighbour, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And far from eye or ear <br>
         
         <center>197<br></center>
         Wan waves and wet winds labour, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Weak ships and spirits steer; <br>
         They drive adrift, and whither <br>
         They wot not who make thither; <br>
         But no such winds blow hither, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And no such things grow here.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         No growth of moor or coppice, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No heather-flower or vine, <br>
         But bloomless buds of poppies, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Green grapes of Proserpine, <br>
         Pale beds of blowing rushes <br>
         Where no leaf blooms or blushes <br>
         Save this whereout she crushes <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For dead men deadly wine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Pale, without name or number, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In fruitless fields of corn, <br>
         They bow themselves and slumber <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All night till light is born; <br>
         And like a soul belated, <br>
         In hell and heaven unmated, <br>
         By cloud and mist abated <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Comes out of darkness morn.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Though one were strong as seven, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         He too with death shall dwell, <br>
         Nor wake with wings in heaven, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor weep for pains in hell; <br>
         
         <center>198<br></center>
         Though one were fair as roses, <br>
         His beauty clouds and closes; <br>
         And well though love reposes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the end it is not well.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Pale, beyond porch and portal, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Crowned with calm leaves, she stands <br>
         Who gathers all things mortal <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With cold immortal hands; <br>
         Her languid lips are sweeter <br>
         Than love's who fears to greet her <br>
         To men that mix and meet her <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From many times and lands.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She waits for each and other, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She waits for all men born; <br>
         Forgets the earth her mother, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The life of fruits and corn; <br>
         And spring and seed and swallow <br>
         Take wing for her and follow <br>
         Where summer song rings hollow <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And flowers are put to scorn.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There go the loves that wither, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The old loves with wearier wings; <br>
         And all dead years draw thither, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And all disastrous things; <br>
         Dead dreams of days forsaken, <br>
         Blind buds that snows have shaken, <br>
         
         <center>199<br></center>
         Wild leaves that winds have taken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Red strays of ruined springs.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We are not sure of sorrow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And joy was never sure; <br>
         To-day will die to-morrow; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Time stoops to no man's lure; <br>
         And love, grown faint and fretful, <br>
         With lips but half regretful <br>
         Sighs, and with eyes forgetful <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Weeps that no loves endure.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         From too much love of living, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From hope and fear set free, <br>
         We thank with brief thanksgiving <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Whatever gods may be <br>
         That no life lives for ever; <br>
         That dead men rise up never; <br>
         That even the weariest river <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Winds somewhere safe to sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then star nor sun shall waken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor any change of light: <br>
         Nor sound of waters shaken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor any sound or sight: <br>
         Nor wintry leaves nor vernal, <br>
         Nor days nor things diurnal; <br>
         Only the sleep eternal <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In an eternal night. <br>

         <h3>HESPERIA</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Out</span> of the golden remote wild west where the sea without
         shore is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Full of the sunset, and sad, if at all, with the
         fulness of joy, <br>
         As a wind sets in with the autumn that blows from the region of
         stories, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Blows with a perfume of songs and of memories beloved
         from a boy, <br>
         Blows from the capes of the past oversea to the bays of the
         present, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Filled as with shadow of sound with the pulse of
         invisible feet, <br>
         Far out to the shallows and straits of the future, by rough ways
         or pleasant, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is it thither the wind's wings beat? is it hither to
         me, O my sweet? <br>
         For thee, in the stream of the deep tide-wind blowing in with the
         water, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thee I behold as a bird borne in with the wind from
         the west, <br>
         
         <center>201<br></center>
         Straight from the sunset, across white waves whence rose as a
         daughter <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Venus thy mother, in years when the world was a water
         at rest.<br>
         Out of the distance of dreams, as a dream that abides after
         slumber, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Strayed from the fugitive flock of the night, when
         the moon overhead <br>
         Wanes in the wan waste heights of the heaven, and stars without
         number <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Die without sound, and are spent like lamps that are
         burnt by the dead, <br>
         Comes back to me, stays by me, lulls me with touch of forgotten
         caresses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One warm dream clad about with a fire as of life that
         endures; <br>
         The delight of thy face, and the sound of thy feet, and the wind
         of thy tresses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And all of a man that regrets, and all of a maid that
         allures. <br>
         But thy bosom is warm for my face and profound as a manifold
         flower, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy silence as music, thy voice as an odour that
         fades in a flame; <br>
         Not a dream, not a dream is the kiss of thy mouth, and the
         bountiful hour <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That makes me forget what was sin, and would make me
         forget were it shame. <br>
         
         <center>202<br></center>
         Thine eyes that are quiet, thine hands that are tender, thy lips
         that are loving, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Comfort and cool me as dew in the dawn of a moon like
         a dream; <br>
         And my heart yearns baffled and blind, moved vainly toward thee,
         and moving <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As the refluent seaweed moves in the languid
         exuberant stream, <br>
         Fair as a rose is on earth, as a rose under water in prison,<br>                
         
         &nbsp;
         That stretches and swings to the slow passionate
         pulse of the sea, <br>
         Closed up from the air and the sun, but alive, as a ghost
         rearisen, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Pale as the love that revives as a ghost rearisen in
         me. <br>
         From the bountiful infinite west, from the happy memorial places <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Full of the stately repose and the lordly delight of
         the dead, <br>
         Where the fortunate islands are lit with the light of ineffable
         faces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the sound of a sea without wind is about them,
         and sunset is red, <br>
         Come back to redeem and release me from love that recalls and
         represses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That cleaves to my flesh as a flame, till the serpent
         has eaten his fill; <br>
         From the bitter delights of the dark, and the feverish, the
         furtive caresses <br>
         
         <center>203<br></center>
         
         &nbsp;
         That murder the youth in a man or ever his heart have
         its will. <br>
         Thy lips cannot laugh and thine eyes cannot weep; thou art pale
         as a rose is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Paler and sweeter than leaves that cover the blush of
         the bud; <br>
         And the heart of the flower is compassion, and pity the core it
         encloses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Pity, not love, that is born of the breath and decays
         with the blood. <br>
         As the cross that a wild nun clasps till the edge of it bruises
         her bosom, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         So love wounds as we grasp it, and blackens and burns
         as a flame;<br>
         I have loved overmuch in my life; when the live bud bursts with
         the blossom, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Bitter as ashes or tears is the fruit, and the wine
         thereof shame. <br>
         As a heart that its anguish divides is the green bud cloven
         asunder; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As the blood of a man self-slain is the flush of the
         leaves that allure; <br>
         And the perfume as poison and wine to the brain, a delight and a
         wonder; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the thorns are too sharp for a boy, too slight
         for a man, to endure. <br>
         Too soon did I love it, and lost love's rose; and I cared not for
         glory's; <br>
         
         <center>204<br></center>
         
         &nbsp;
         Only the blossoms of sleep and of pleasure were mixed
         in my hair. <br>
         Was it myrtle or poppy thy garland was woven with, O my Dolores? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Was it pallor of slumber, or blush as of blood, that
         I found in thee fair? <br>
         For desire is a respite from love, and the flesh not the heart is
         her fuel; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She was sweet to me once, who am fled and escaped
         from the rage of her reign; <br>
         Who behold as of old time at hand as I turn, with her mouth
         growing cruel, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And flushed as with wine with the blood of her
         lovers, Our Lady of Pain. <br>
         Low down where the thicket is thicker with thorns than with
         leaves in the summer, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the brake is a gleaming of eyes and a hissing of
         tongues that I knew; <br>
         And the lithe long throats of her snakes reach round her, their
         mouths overcome her,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And her lips grow cool with their foam, made moist as
         a desert with dew. <br>
         With the thirst and the hunger of lust though her beautiful lips
         be so bitter, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With the cold foul foam of the snakes they soften and
         redden and smile; <br>
         And her fierce mouth sweetens, her eyes wax wide and her
         eyelashes glitter, <br>
         
         <center>205<br></center>
         
         &nbsp;
         And she laughs with a savour of blood in her face,
         and a savour of guile. <br>
         She laughs, and her hands reach hither, her hair blows hither and
         hisses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As a low-lit flame in a wind, back-blown till it
         shudder and leap; <br>
         Let her lips not again lay hold on my soul, nor her poisonous
         kisses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To consume it alive and divide from thy bosom, Our
         Lady of Sleep. <br>
         Ah daughter of sunset and slumber, if now it return into prison, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who shall redeem it anew? but we, if thou wilt, let
         us fly; <br>
         Let us take to us, now that the white skies thrill with a moon
         unarisen, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Swift horses of fear or of love, take flight and
         depart and not die. <br>
         They are swifter than dreams, they are stronger than death; there
         is none that hath ridden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         None that shall ride in the dim strange ways of his
         life as we ride; <br>
         By the meadows of memory, the highlands of hope, and the shore
         that is hidden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where life breaks loud and unseen, a sonorous
         invisible tide;<br>
         By the sands where sorrow has trodden, the salt pools bitter and
         sterile, <br>
         
         <center>206<br></center>
         
         &nbsp;
         By the thundering reef and the low sea-wall and the
         channel of years, <br>
         Our wild steeds press on the night, strain hard through pleasure
         and peril, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Labour and listen and pant not or pause for the peril
         that nears; <br>
         And the sound of them trampling the way cleaves night as an arrow
         asunder, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And slow by the sand-hill and swift by the down with
         its glimpses of grass, <br>
         Sudden and steady the music, as eight hoofs trample and thunder, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Rings in the ear of the low blind wind of the night
         as we pass; <br>
         Shrill shrieks in our faces the blind bland air that was mute as
         a maiden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Stung into storm by the speed of our passage, and
         deaf where we past; <br>
         And our spirits too burn as we bound, thine holy but mine
         heavy-laden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As we burn with the fire of our flight; ah love,
         shall we win at the last? <br>

         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Or sail or row? <br>
         There's many a wind and way, <br>

         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And joys that were; <br>
         Our ballast is a rose; <br>
         Our way lies where God knows <br>

         Our decks fine gold; <br>

         Our ropes are dead maids' hair, <br>
         Our stores are love-shafts fair <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And manifold. <br>
         We are in love's land to-dayâ <br>
         
         <br><br>
         Where shall we land you, sweet? <br>
         On fields of strange men's feet, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Or fields near home? <br>
         Or where the fire-flowers blow, <br>
         Or where the flowers of snow <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Or flowers of foam? <br>
         We are in love's hand to-dayâ <br>

         Land me, she says, where love <br>
         Shows but one shaft, one dove, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         One heart, one hand. <br>
         âA shore like that, my dear, <br>
         Lies where no man will steer, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         No maiden land. <br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">When</span> the fields catch flower <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the underwood is green, <br>
         And from bower unto bower <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The songs of the birds begin, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I sing with sighing between. <br>
         When I laugh and sing, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I am heavy at heart for my sin; <br>
         I am sad in the spring <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For my love that I shall not win, <br>
         For a foolish thing.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         This profit I have of my woe, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That I know, as I sing, <br>
         I know he will needs have it so <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who is master and king, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who is lord of the spirit of spring. <br>
         
         <center>210<br></center>
         I will serve her and will not spare <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till her pity awake <br>
         Who is good, who is pure, who is fair, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Even her for whose sake <br>
         Love hath ta'en me and slain unaware.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O my lord, O Love, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I have laid my life at thy feet; <br>
         Have thy will thereof, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Do as it please thee with it, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For what shall please thee is sweet. <br>
         I am come unto thee <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To do thee service, O Love; <br>
         Yet cannot I see <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou wilt take any pity thereof, <br>
         Any mercy on me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But the grace I have long time sought <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Comes never in sight, <br>
         If in her it abideth not, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Through thy mercy and might, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Whose heart is the world's delight. <br>
         Thou hast sworn without fail I shall die, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For my heart is set <br>
         On what hurts me, I wot not why, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But cannot forget <br>
         What I love, what I sing for and sigh.<br>
         
         
         <center>211<br></center>
         <br><br>
         She is worthy of praise, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For this grief of her giving is worth <br>
         All the joy of my days <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That lie between death's day and birth, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All the lordship of things upon earth. <br>
         Nay, what have I said? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I would not be glad if I could; <br>
         My dream and my dread <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Are of her, and for her sake I would <br>
         That my life were fled.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Lo, sweet, if I durst not pray to you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then were I dead; <br>
         If I sang not a little to say to you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         (Could it be said) <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O my love, how my heart would be fed; <br>
         Ah sweet who hast hold of my heart, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For thy love's sake I live, <br>
         Do but tell me, ere either depart, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What a lover may give <br>
         For a woman so fair as thou art.<br>

         False rumours shall grieve <br>
         And evil-speaking shall part.<br>

         <h3>BEFORE PARTING</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">A month</span> or twain to live on honeycomb <br>
         Is pleasant; but one tires of scented time, <br>
         Cold sweet recurrence of accepted rhyme, <br>
         And that strong purple under juice and foam <br>
         Where the wine's heart has burst; <br>
         Nor feel the latter kisses like the first.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Once yet, this poor one time; I will not pray <br>
         Even to change the bitterness of it, <br>
         The bitter taste ensuing on the sweet, <br>
         To make your tears fall where your soft hair lay <br>
         All blurred and heavy in some perfumed wise <br>
         Over my face and eyes.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And yet who knows what end the scythÃ¨d wheat <br>
         Makes of its foolish poppies' mouths of red? <br>
         These were not sown, these are not harvested, <br>
         They grow a month and are cast under feet <br>
         And none has care thereof, <br>
         As none has care of a divided love.<br>
         
         <center>213<br></center>
         <br><br>
         I know each shadow of your lips by rote, <br>
         Each change of love in eyelids and eyebrows; <br>
         The fashion of fair temples tremulous<br>
         With tender blood, and colour of your throat; <br>
         I know not how love is gone out of this, <br>
         Seeing that all was his.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Love's likeness there endures upon all these: <br>
         But out of these one shall not gather love. <br>
         Day hath not strength nor the night shade enough <br>
         To make love whole and fill his lips with ease, <br>
         As some bee-builded cell <br>
         Feels at filled lips the heavy honey swell.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I know not how this last month leaves your hair <br>
         Less full of purple colour and hid spice, <br>
         And that luxurious trouble of closed eyes <br>
         Is mixed with meaner shadow and waste care; <br>
         And love, kissed out by pleasure, seems not yet <br>
         Worth patience to regret. <br>

         <h3>THE SUNDEW.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">A little</span> marsh-plant, yellow green, <br>
         And pricked at lip with tender red. <br>
         Tread close, and either way you tread <br>
         Some faint black water jets between <br>
         Lest you should bruise the curious head.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         A live thing maybe; who shall know? <br>
         The summer knows and suffers it; <br>
         For the cool moss is thick and sweet <br>
         Each side, and saves the blossom so <br>
         That it lives out the long June heat.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The deep scent of the heather burns <br>
         About it; breathless though it be, <br>
         Bow down and worship; more than we <br>
         Is the least flower whose life returns, <br>
         Least weed renascent in the sea.<br>
         
         <center>215<br></center>
         <br><br>
         We are vexed and cumbered in earth's sight <br>
         With wants, with many memories; <br>
         These see their mother what she is, <br>
         Glad-growing, till August leave more bright <br>
         The apple-coloured cranberries.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Wind blows and bleaches the strong grass, <br>
         Blown all one way to shelter it <br>
         From trample of strayed kine, with feet <br>
         Felt heavier than the moorhen was, <br>
         Strayed up past patches of wild wheat.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         You call it sundew: how it grows, <br>
         If with its colour it have breath, <br>
         If life taste sweet to it, if death <br>
         Pain its soft petal, no man knows: <br>
         Man has no sight or sense that saith.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         My sundew, grown of gentle days, <br>
         In these green miles the spring begun <br>
         Thy growth ere April had half done <br>
         With the soft secret of her ways <br>
         Or June made ready for the sun.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O red-lipped mouth of marsh-flower, <br>
         I have a secret halved with thee. <br>
         The name that is love's name to me <br>
         Thou knowest, and the face of her <br>
         Who is my festival to see.<br>
         
         
         <center>216<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The hard sun, as thy petals knew, <br>
         Coloured the heavy moss-water: <br>
         Thou wert not worth green midsummer <br>
         Nor fit to live to August blue, <br>
         O sundew, not remembering her. <br>

         <h3>FÃLISE</h3>
         
         
         <i>Mais oÃ¹ sont les neiges d'antan?</i>
         
         
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">What</span> shall be said between us here<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Among the downs, between the trees,<br>
         In fields that knew our feet last year,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In sight of quiet sands and seas,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This year, FÃ©lise?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Who knows what word were best to say?<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For last year's leaves lie dead and red<br>
         On this sweet day, in this green May,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And barren corn makes bitter bread.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What shall be said?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Here as last year the fields begin,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A fire of flowers and glowing grass;<br>
         The old fields we laughed and lingered in,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Seeing each our souls in last year's glass,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         FÃ©lise, alas!<br>
         
         
         <center>218<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Shall we not laugh, shall we not weep,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Not we, though this be as it is?<br>
         For love awake or love asleep<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ends in a laugh, a dream, a kiss,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A song like this.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I that have slept awake, and you<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sleep, who last year were well awake.<br>
         Though love do all that love can do,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         My heart will never ache or break<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For your heart's sake.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The great sea, faultless as a flower,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Throbs, trembling under beam and breeze,<br>
         And laughs with love of the amorous hour.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I found you fairer once, FÃ©lise,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than flowers or seas.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We played at bondsman and at queen;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But as the days change men change too;<br>
         I find the grey sea's notes of green,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The green sea's fervent flakes of blue,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         More fair than you.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Your beauty is not over fair<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Now in mine eyes, who am grown up wise.<br>
         The smell of flowers in all your hair<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Allures not now; no sigh replies<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If your heart sighs.<br>
         
         
         <center>219<br></center>
         <br><br>
         But you sigh seldom, you sleep sound,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         You find love's new name good enough.<br>
         Less sweet I find it than I found<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The sweetest name that ever love<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Grew weary of.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         My snake with bright bland eyes, my snake<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Grown tame and glad to be caressed,<br>
         With lips athirst for mine to slake<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Their tender fever! who had guessed<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         You loved me best?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I had died for this last year, to know<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         You loved me. Who shall turn on fate?<br>
         I care not if love come or go<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Now, though your love seek mine for mate.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         It is too late.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The dust of many strange desires<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lies deep between us; in our eyes<br>
         Dead smoke of perishable fires<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Flickers, a fume in air and skies,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A steam of sighs.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         You loved me and you loved me not;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A little, much, and overmuch.<br>
         Will you forget as I forget?<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Let all dead things lie dead; none such<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Are soft to touch.<br>
         
         
         <center>220<br></center>
         <br><br>
         I love you and I do not love,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Too much, a little, not at all:<br>
         Too much, and never yet enough.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Birds quick to fledge and fly at call<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Are quick to fall.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And these love longer now than men,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And larger loves than ours are these.<br>
         No diver brings up love again<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Dropped once, my beautiful FÃ©lise,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In such cold seas.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Gone deeper than all plummets sound,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where in the dim green dayless day<br>
         The life of such dead things lies bound<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As the sea feeds on, wreck and stray<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And castaway.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Can I forget? yea, that can I,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And that can all men; so will you,<br>
         Alive, or later, when you die.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ah, but the love you plead was true?<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Was mine not too?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I loved you for that name of yours<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Long ere we met, and long enough.<br>
         Now that one thing of all enduresâ <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The sweetest name that ever love<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Waxed weary of.<br>
         
         
         <center>221<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Like colours in the sea, like flowers,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Like a cat's splendid circled eyes<br>
         That wax and wane with love for hours,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Green as green flame, blue-grey like skies,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And soft like sighsâ<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And all these only like your name,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And your name full of all of these.<br>
         I say it, and it sounds the sameâ <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Save that I say it now at ease,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Your name, FÃ©lise.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I said ``she must be swift and white,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And subtly warm, and half perverse,<br>
         And sweet like sharp soft fruit to bite,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And like a snake's love lithe and fierce.''<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Men have guessed worse.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         What was the song I made of you<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Here where the grass forgets our feet<br>
         As afternoon forgets the dew?<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ah that such sweet things should be fleet,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Such fleet things sweet!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         As afternoon forgets the dew,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As time in time forgets all men,<br>
         As our old place forgets us two,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who might have turned to one thing then,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But not again.<br>
         
         <center>222<br></center>
         
         <br><br>
         
         O lips that mine have grown into
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Like April's kissing May,
         <br>
         
         O fervent eyelids letting through
         <br>
         
         Those eyes the greenest of things blue,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         The bluest of things grey,
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         If you were I and I were you,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         How could I love you, say?
         <br>
         
         How could the roseleaf love the rue,
         <br>
         
         The day love nightfall and her dew,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Though night may love the day?
         <br>
         
         
         <br><br>
         You loved it may be more than I;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We know not; love is hard to seize,<br>
         And all things are not good to try;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And lifelong loves the worst of these<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For us, FÃ©lise.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah, take the season and have done,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Love well the hour and let it go:<br>
         Two souls may sleep and wake up one,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or dream they wake and find it so,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And thenâyou know.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Kiss me once hard as though a flame<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lay on my lips and made them fire;<br>
         The same lips now, and not the same;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What breath shall fill and re-inspire<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A dead desire?<br>
         
         
         <center>223<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The old song sounds hollower in mine ear<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than thin keen sounds of dead men's speechâ <br>
         A noise one hears and would not hear;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Too strong to die, too weak to reach<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From wave to beach.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We stand on either side the sea,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Stretch hands, blow kisses, laugh and lean<br>
         I toward you, you toward me;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But what hears either save the keen<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Grey sea between?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         A year divides us, love from love,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though you love now, though I loved then.<br>
         The gulf is strait, but deep enough;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who shall recross, who among men<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall cross again?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Love was a jest last year, you said,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And what lives surely, surely dies.<br>
         Even so; but now that love is dead,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall love rekindle from wet eyes,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From subtle sighs?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For many loves are good to see,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Mutable loves, and loves perverse;<br>
         But there is nothing, nor shall be,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         So sweet, so wicked, but my verse<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Can dream of worse.<br>
         
         <center>224<br></center>
         <br><br>
         For we that sing and you that love<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Know that which man may, only we.<br>
         The rest live under us; above,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Live the great gods in heaven, and see<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What things shall be.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         So this thing is and must be so;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For man dies, and love also dies.<br>
         Though yet love's ghost moves to and fro<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The sea-green mirrors of your eyes,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And laughs, and lies.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Eyes coloured like a water-flower,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And deeper than the green sea's glass;<br>
         Eyes that remember one sweet hourâ<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In vain we swore it should not pass;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In vain, alas!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah my FÃ©lise, if love or sin,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If shame or fear could hold it fast,<br>
         Should we not hold it? Love wears thin,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And they laugh well who laugh the last.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is it not past?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The gods, the gods are stronger; time<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Falls down before them, all men's knees<br>
         Bow, all men's prayers and sorrows climb<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Like incense towards them; yea, for these<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Are gods, FÃ©lise.<br>

         Immortal are they, clothed with powers,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Not to be comforted at all;<br>
         Lords over all the fruitless hours;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Too great to appease, too high to appal,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Too far to call.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For none shall move the most high gods,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who are most sad, being cruel; none<br>
         Shall break or take away the rods<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wherewith they scourge us, not as one<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That smites a son.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         By many a name of many a creed<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We have called upon them, since the sands<br>
         Fell through time's hour-glass first, a seed<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of life; and out of many lands<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Have we stretched hands.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         When have they heard us? who hath known<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Their faces, climbed unto their feet,<br>
         Felt them and found them? Laugh or groan,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Doth heaven remurmur and repeat<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sad sounds or sweet?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Do the stars answer? in the night<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Have ye found comfort? or by day<br>
         Have ye seen gods? What hope, what light,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Falls from the farthest starriest way<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         On you that pray?<br>
         
         
         <center>226<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Are the skies wet because we weep,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or fair because of any mirth?<br>
         Cry out; they are gods; perchance they sleep;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Cry; thou shalt know what prayers are worth,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou dust and earth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O earth, thou art fair; O dust, thou art great;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O laughing lips and lips that mourn,<br>
         Pray, till ye feel the exceeding weight<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of God's intolerable scorn,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Not to be borne.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Behold, there is no grief like this;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The barren blossom of thy prayer,<br>
         Thou shalt find out how sweet it is.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O fools and blind, what seek ye there,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         High up in the air?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ye must have gods, the friends of men,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Merciful gods, compassionate,<br>
         And these shall answer you again.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Will ye beat always at the gate,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ye fools of fate?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ye fools and blind; for this is sure,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That all ye shall not live, but die.<br>
         Lo, what thing have ye found endure?<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or what thing have ye found on high<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Past the blind sky?<br>
         
         
         <center>227<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The ghosts of words and dusty dreams,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Old memories, faiths infirm and dead.<br>
         Ye fools; for which among you deems<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         His prayer can alter green to red<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or stones to bread?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Why should ye bear with hopes and fears<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till all these things be drawn in one,<br>
         The sound of iron-footed years,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And all the oppression that is done<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Under the sun?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ye might end surely, surely pass<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Out of the multitude of things,<br>
         Under the dust, beneath the grass,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Deep in dim death, where no thought stings,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No record clings.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         No memory more of love or hate,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No trouble, nothing that aspires,<br>
         No sleepless labour thwarting fate,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And thwarted; where no travail tires,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where no faith fires.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All passes, nought that has been is,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Things good and evil have one end.<br>
         Can anything be otherwise<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though all men swear all things would mend<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With God to friend?<br>
         
         
         <center>228<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Can ye beat off one wave with prayer,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Can ye move mountains? bid the flower<br>
         Take flight and turn to a bird in the air?<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Can ye hold fast for shine or shower<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One wingless hour?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah sweet, and we too, can we bring<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One sigh back, bid one smile revive?<br>
         Can God restore one ruined thing,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or he who slays our souls alive<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Make dead things thrive?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Two gifts perforce he has given us yet,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though sad things stay and glad things fly;<br>
         Two gifts he has given us, to forget<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All glad and sad things that go by,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And then to die.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We know not whether death be good,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But life at least it will not be:<br>
         Men will stand saddening as we stood,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Watch the same fields and skies as we<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the same sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let this be said between us here,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One love grows green when one turns grey;<br>
         This year knows nothing of last year;<br>

         Live and let live, as I will do,<br>

         Love and let love, and so will I.<br>
         But, sweet, for me no more with you:<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Not while I live, not though I die.<br>
         
         &nbsp;

         <h3>AN INTERLUDE.</h3>
         <br><br>
          In the greenest growth of the Maytime, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          I rode where the woods were wet, <br>
          Between the dawn and the daytime; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          The spring was glad that we met. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          There was something the season wanted, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          Though the ways and the woods smelt sweet; <br>
          The breath at your lips that panted, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          The pulse of the grass at your feet. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          You came, and the sun came after, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          And the green grew golden above; <br>
          And the flag-flowers lightened with laughter, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          And the meadow-sweet shook with love. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          Your feet in the full-grown grasses <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          Moved soft as a weak wind blows; <br>
          You passed me as April passes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          With face made out of a rose. <br>
         
         
         <center>231<br></center>
         <br><br>
          By the stream where the stems were slender, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          Your bright foot paused at the sedge; <br>
          It might be to watch the tender <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          Light leaves in the springtime hedge, <br>
         
         <br><br>
          On boughs that the sweet month blanches <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          With flowery frost of May: <br>
          It might be a bird in the branches, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          It might be a thorn in the way. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          I waited to watch you linger <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          With foot drawn back from the dew, <br>
          Till a sunbeam straight like a finger <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          Struck sharp through the leaves at you. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          And a bird overhead sang <i>Follow</i>, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          And a bird to the right sang <i>Here;</i> <br>
          And the arch of the leaves was hollow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          And the meaning of May was clear. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          I saw where the sun's hand pointed, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          I knew what the bird's note said; <br>
          By the dawn and the dewfall anointed, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          You were queen by the gold on your head. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          As the glimpse of a burnt-out ember <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          Recalls a regret of the sun, <br>
          I remember, forget, and remember <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          What Love saw done and undone. <br>
         
         
         <center>232<br></center>
         <br><br>
          I remember the way we parted, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          The day and the way we met; <br>
          You hoped we were both broken-hearted, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          And knew we should both forget. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          And May with her world in flower <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          Seemed still to murmur and smile <br>
          As you murmured and smiled for an hour; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          I saw you turn at the stile. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          A hand like a white wood-blossom <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          You lifted, and waved, and passed, <br>
          With head hung down to the bosom, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          And pale, as it seemed, at last. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          And the best and the worst of this is <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          That neither is most to blame <br>
          If you've forgotten my kisses <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          And I've forgotten your name. <br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">In </span>the month of the long decline of roses <br>
         I, beholding the summer dead before me, <br>
         Set my face to the sea and journeyed silent, <br>
         Gazing eagerly where above the sea-mark <br>
         Flame as fierce as the fervid eyes of lions <br>
         Half divided the eyelids of the sunset; <br>
         Till I heard as it were a noise of waters <br>
         Moving tremulous under feet of angels <br>
         Multitudinous, out of all the heavens; <br>
         Knew the fluttering wind, the fluttered foliage, <br>
         Shaken fitfully, full of sound and shadow; <br>
         And saw, trodden upon by noiseless angels, <br>
         Long mysterious reaches fed with moonlight, <br>
         Sweet sad straits in a soft subsiding channel, <br>
         Blown about by the lips of winds I knew not, <br>
         Winds not born in the north nor any quarter, <br>
         Winds not warm with the south nor any sunshine; <br>
         Heard between them a voice of exultation, <br>
         "Lo, the summer is dead, the sun is faded, <br>
         Even like as a leaf the year is withered, <br>
         
         <center>234<br></center>
         All the fruits of the day from all her branches <br>
         Gathered, neither is any left to gather. <br>
         All the flowers are dead, the tender blossoms, <br>
         All are taken away; the season wasted, <br>
         Like an ember among the fallen ashes.<br>
         Now with light of the winter days, with moonlight, <br>
         Light of snow, and the bitter light of hoarfrost, <br>
         We bring flowers that fade not after autumn, <br>
         Pale white chaplets and crowns of latter seasons, <br>
         Fair false leaves (but the summer leaves were falser), <br>
         Woven under the eyes of stars and planets <br>
         When low light was upon the windy reaches <br>
         Where the flower of foam was blown, a lily <br>
         Dropt among the sonorous fruitless furrows <br>
         And green fields of the sea that make no pasture: <br>
         Since the winter begins, the weeping winter, <br>
         All whose flowers are tears, and round his temples <br>
         Iron blossom of frost is bound for ever." <br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">All</span> the night sleep came not upon my eyelids, <br>
         Shed not dew, nor shook nor unclosed a feather, <br>
         Yet with lips shut close and with eyes of iron <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Stood and beheld me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then to me so lying awake a vision <br>
         Came without sleep over the seas and touched me, <br>
         Softly touched mine eyelids and lips; and I too, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Full of the vision,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Saw the white implacable Aphrodite, <br>
         Saw the hair unbound and the feet unsandalled <br>
         Shine as fire of sunset on western waters; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Saw the reluctant<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Feet, the straining plumes of the doves that drew her, <br>
         Looking always, looking with necks reverted, <br>
         Back to Lesbos, back to the hills whereunder <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shone Mitylene;<br>
         
         
         <center>236<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Heard the flying feet of the Loves behind her <br>
         Make a sudden thunder upon the waters, <br>
         As the thunder flung from the strong unclosing <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wings of a great wind.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         So the goddess fled from her place, with awful <br>
         Sound of feet and thunder of wings around her; <br>
         While behind a clamour of singing women <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Severed the twilight.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah the singing, ah the delight, the passion! <br>
         All the Loves wept, listening; sick with anguish, <br>
         Stood the crowned nine Muses about Apollo; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fear was upon them,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         While the tenth sang wonderful things they knew not. <br>
         Ah the tenth, the Lesbian! the nine were silent, <br>
         None endured the sound of her song for weeping; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Laurel by laurel,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Faded all their crowns; but about her forehead, <br>
         Round her woven tresses and ashen temples <br>
         White as dead snow, paler than grass in summer, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ravaged with kisses,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Shone a light of fire as a crown for ever. <br>
         Yea, almost the implacable Aphrodite <br>
         Paused, and almost wept; such a song was that song. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yea, by her name too<br>
         
         
         <center>237<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Called her, saying, ''Turn to me, O my Sappho;'' <br>
         Yet she turned her face from the Loves, she saw not <br>
         Tears for laughter darken immortal eyelids, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Heard not about her<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Fearful fitful wings of the doves departing, <br>
         Saw not how the bosom of Aphrodite <br>
         Shook with weeping, saw not her shaken raiment, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Saw not her hands wrung;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Saw the Lesbians kissing across their smitten <br>
         Lutes with lips more sweet than the sound of lute-strings, <br>
         Mouth to mouth and hand upon hand, her chosen, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fairer than all men;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Only saw the beautiful lips and fingers, <br>
         Full of songs and kisses and little whispers, <br>
         Full of music; only beheld among them <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Soar, as a bird soars<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Newly fledged, her visible song, a marvel, <br>
         Made of perfect sound and exceeding passion, <br>
         Sweetly shapen, terrible, full of thunders, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Clothed with the wind's wings.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then rejoiced she, laughing with love, and scattered <br>
         Roses, awful roses of holy blossom; <br>
         Then the Loves thronged sadly with hidden faces <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Round Aphrodite,<br>
         
         
         <center>238<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Then the Muses, stricken at heart, were silent; <br>
         Yea, the gods waxed pale; such a song was that song. <br>
         All reluctant, all with a fresh repulsion, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fled from before her.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All withdrew long since, and the land was barren, <br>
         Full of fruitless women and music only. <br>
         Now perchance, when winds are assuaged at sunset, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lulled at the dewfall,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         By the grey sea-side, unassuaged, unheard of, <br>
         Unbeloved, unseen in the ebb of twilight, <br>
         Ghosts of outcast women return lamenting, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Purged not in Lethe,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Clothed about with flame and with tears, and singing <br>
         Songs that move the heart of the shaken heaven, <br>
         Songs that break the heart of the earth with pity, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Hearing, to hear them. <br>

         <h3> AT ELEUSIS. </h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase"> Men </span> of Eleusis, ye that with long staves <br>
          Sit in the market-houses, and speak words <br>
          Made sweet with wisdom as the rare wine is <br>
          Thickened with honey; and ye sons of these <br>
          Who in the glad thick streets go up and down <br>
          For pastime or grave traffic or mere chance; <br>
          And all fair women having rings of gold <br>
          On hands or hair; and chiefest over these <br>
          I name you, daughters of this man the king, <br>
          Who dipping deep smooth pitchers of pure brass <br>
          Under the bubbled wells, till each round lip <br>
          Stooped with loose gurgle of waters incoming, <br>
          Found me an old sick woman, lamed and lean, <br>
          Beside a growth of builded olive-boughs <br>
          Whence multiplied thick song of thick-plumed throatsâ <br>
          Also wet tears filled up my hollow hands <br>
          By reason of my crying into themâ <br>
          And pitied me; for as cold water ran <br>
          And washed the pitchers full from lip to lip, <br>
          So washed both eyes full the strong salt of tears. <br>
         
         <center>240<br></center>
          And ye put water to my mouth, made sweet <br>
          With brown hill-berries; so in time I spoke <br>
          And gathered my loose knees from under me. <br>
          Moreover in the broad fair halls this month <br>
          Have I found space and bountiful abode <br>
          To please me. I Demeter speak of this, <br>
          Who am the mother and the mate of things: <br>
          For as ill men by drugs or singing words <br>
          Shut the doors inward of the narrowed womb <br>
          Like a lock bolted with round iron through, <br>
          Thus I shut up the body and sweet mouth <br>
          Of all soft pasture and the tender land, <br>
          So that no seed can enter in by it <br>
          Though one sow thickly, nor some grain get out <br>
          Past the hard clods men cleave and bite with steel <br>
          To widen the sealed lips of them for use. <br>
          None of you is there in the peopled street <br>
          But knows how all the dry-drawn furrows ache <br>
          With no green spot made count of in the black: <br>
          How the wind finds no comfortable grass <br>
          Nor is assuaged with bud nor breath of herbs; <br>
          And in hot autumn when ye house the stacks, <br>
          All fields are helpless in the sun, all trees <br>
          Stand as a man stripped out of all but skin. <br>
          Nevertheless ye sick have help to get <br>
          By means and stablished ordinance of God; <br>
          For God is wiser than a good man is. <br>
          But never shall new grass be sweet in earth <br>
         
         <center>241<br></center>
          Till I get righted of my wound and wrong <br>
          By changing counsel of ill-minded Zeus. <br>
          For of all other gods is none save me <br>
          Clothed with like power to build and break the year. <br>
          I make the lesser green begin, when spring <br>
          Touches not earth but with one fearful foot; <br>
          And as a careful gilder with grave art <br>
          Soberly colours and completes the face, <br>
          Mouth, chin and all, of some sweet work in stone, <br>
          I carve the shapes of grass and tender corn <br>
          And colour the ripe edges and long spikes <br>
          With the red increase and the grace of gold. <br>
          No tradesman in soft wools is cunninger <br>
          To kill the secret of the fat white fleece <br>
          With stains of blue and purple wrought in it. <br>
          Three moons were made and three moons burnt away <br>
          While I held journey hither out of Crete <br>
          Comfortless, tended by grave Hecate <br>
          Whom my wound stung with double iron point; <br>
          For all my face was like a cloth wrung out <br>
          With close and weeping wrinkles, and both lids <br>
          Sodden with salt continuance of tears. <br>
          For Hades and the sidelong will of Zeus <br>
          And that lame wisdom that has writhen feet, <br>
          Cunning, begotten in the bed of Shame, <br>
          These three took evil will at me, and made <br>
          Such counsel that when time got wing to fly <br>
          This Hades out of summer and low fields <br>
         
         <center>242<br></center>
          Forced the bright body of Persephone: <br>
          Out of pure grass, where she lying down, red flowers <br>
          Made their sharp little shadows on her sides, <br>
          Pale heat, pale colour on pale maiden fleshâ <br>
          And chill water slid over her reddening feet, <br>
          Killing the throbs in their soft blood; and birds, <br>
          Perched next her elbow and pecking at her hair, <br>
          Stretched their necks more to see her than even to sing. <br>
          A sharp thing is it I have need to say; <br>
          For Hades holding both white wrists of hers <br>
          Unloosed the girdle and with knot by knot <br>
          Bound her between his wheels upon the seat, <br>
          Bound her pure body, holiest yet and dear <br>
          To me and God as always, clothed about <br>
          With blossoms loosened as her knees went down, <br>
          Let fall as she let go of this and this <br>
          By tens and twenties, tumbled to her feet, <br>
          White waifs or purple of the pasturage. <br>
          Therefore with only going up and down <br>
          My feet were wasted, and the gracious air, <br>
          To me discomfortable and dun, became <br>
          As weak smoke blowing in the under world. <br>
          And finding in the process of ill days <br>
          What part had Zeus herein, and how as mate <br>
          He coped with Hades, yokefellow in sin, <br>
          I set my lips against the meat of gods <br>
          And drank not neither ate or slept in heaven. <br>
          Nor in the golden greeting of their mouths <br>
         
         <center>243<br></center>
          Did ear take note of me, nor eye at all <br>
          Track my feet going in the ways of them. <br>
          Like a great fire on some strait slip of land <br>
          Between two washing inlets of wet sea <br>
          That burns the grass up to each lip of beach <br>
          And strengthens, waxing in the growth of wind, <br>
          So burnt my soul in me at heaven and earth, <br>
          Each way a ruin and a hungry plague, <br>
          Visible evil; nor could any night <br>
          Put cool between mine eyelids, nor the sun <br>
          With competence of gold fill out my want. <br>
          Yea so my flame burnt up the grass and stones, <br>
          Shone to the salt-white edges of thin sea, <br>
          Distempered all the gracious work, and made <br>
          Sick change, unseasonable increase of days <br>
          And scant avail of seasons; for by this <br>
          The fair gods faint in hollow heaven: there comes <br>
          No taste of burnings of the twofold fat <br>
          To leave their palates smooth, nor in their lips <br>
          Soft rings of smoke and weak scent wandering; <br>
          All cattle waste and rot, and their ill smell <br>
          Grows alway from the lank unsavoury flesh <br>
          That no man slays for offering; the sea <br>
          And waters moved between the heath and corn <br>
          Preserve the people of fin-twinkling fish, <br>
          And river-flies feed thick upon the smooth; <br>
          But all earth over is no man or bird <br>
          (Except the sweet race of the kingfisher) <br>
         
         <center>244<br></center>
          That lacks not and is wearied with much loss. <br>
          Meantime the purple inward of the house <br>
          Was softened with all grace of scent and sound <br>
          In ear and nostril perfecting my praise; <br>
          Faint grape-flowers and cloven honey-cake <br>
          And the just grain with dues of the shed salt <br>
          Made me content: yet my hand loosened not <br>
          Its gripe upon your harvest all year long. <br>
          While I, thus woman-muffled in wan flesh <br>
          And waste externals of a perished face, <br>
          Preserved the levels of my wrath and love <br>
          Patiently ruled; and with soft offices <br>
          Cooled the sharp noons and busied the warm nights <br>
          In care of this my choice, this child my choice, <br>
          Triptolemus, the king's selected son: <br>
          That this fair yearlong body, which hath grown <br>
          Strong with strange milk upon the mortal lip <br>
          And nerved with half a god, might so increase <br>
          Outside the bulk and the bare scope of man: <br>
          And waxen over large to hold within <br>
          Base breath of yours and this impoverished air, <br>
          I might exalt him past the flame of stars, <br>
          The limit and walled reach of the great world. <br>
          Therefore my breast made common to his mouth <br>
          Immortal savours, and the taste whereat <br>
          Twice their hard life strains out the coloured veins <br>
          And twice its brain confirms the narrow shell. <br>
          Also at night, unwinding cloth from cloth <br>
         
         <center>245<br></center>
          As who unhusks an almond to the white <br>
          And pastures curiously the purer taste, <br>
          I bared the gracious limbs and the soft feet, <br>
          Unswaddled the weak hands, and in mid ash <br>
          Laid the sweet flesh of either feeble side, <br>
          More tender for impressure of some touch <br>
          Than wax to any pen; and lit around <br>
          Fire, and made crawl the white worm-shapen flame, <br>
          And leap in little angers spark by spark <br>
          At head at once and feet; and the faint hair <br>
          Hissed with rare sprinkles in the closer curl, <br>
          And like scaled oarage of a keen thin fish <br>
          In sea-water, so in pure fire his feet <br>
          Struck out, and the flame bit not in his flesh <br>
          But like a kiss it curled his lip, and heat <br>
          Fluttered his eyelids; so each night I blew <br>
          The hot ash red to purge him to full god. <br>
          Ill is it when fear hungers in the soul <br>
          For painful food, and chokes thereon, being fed; <br>
          And ill slant eyes interpret the straight sun, <br>
          But in their scope its white is wried to black: <br>
          By the queen Metaneira mean I this; <br>
          For with sick wrath upon her lips, and heart, <br>
          Narrowing with fear the spleenful passages, <br>
          She thought to thread this web's fine ravel out, <br>
          Nor leave her shuttle split in combing it; <br>
          Therefore she stole on us, and with hard sight <br>
          Peered, and stooped close; then with pale open mouth <br>
         
         <center>246<br></center>
          As the fire smote her in the eyes between <br>
          Cried, and the child's laugh, sharply shortening <br>
          As fire doth under rain, fell off; the flame <br>
          Writhed once all through and died, and in thick dark <br>
          Tears fell from mine on the child's weeping eyes, <br>
          Eyes dispossessed of strong inheritance <br>
          And mortal fallen anew. Who not the less <br>
          From bud of beard to pale-grey flower of hair <br>
          Shall wax vinewise to a lordly vine, whose grapes <br>
          Bleed the red heavy blood of swoln soft wine, <br>
          Subtle with sharp leaves' intricacy, until <br>
          Full of white years and blossom of hoary days <br>
          I take him perfected; for whose one sake <br>
          I am thus gracious to the least who stands <br>
          Filleted with white wool and girt upon <br>
          As he whose prayer endures upon the lip <br>
          And falls not waste: wherefore let sacrifice <br>
          Burn and run red in all the wider ways; <br>
          Seeing I have sworn by the pale temples' band <br>
          And poppied hair of gold Persephone <br>
          Sad-tressed and pleached low down about her brows, <br>
          And by the sorrow in her lips, and death <br>
          Her dumb and mournful-mouthÃ¨d minister, <br>
          My word for you is eased of its harsh weight <br>
          And doubled with soft promise; and your king <br>
          Triptolemus, this Celeus dead and swathed <br>
          Purple and pale for golden burial, <br>
          Shall be your helper in my services, <br>
         
         <center>247<br></center>
          Dividing earth and reaping fruits thereof <br>
          In fields where wait, well-girt, well-wreathen, all <br>
          The heavy-handed seasons all year through; <br>
          Saving the choice of warm spear-headed grain, <br>
          And stooping sharp to the slant-sided share <br>
          All beasts that furrow the remeasured land <br>
          With their bowed necks of burden equable. <br>

         <h3>AUGUST</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">There</span> were four apples on the bough, <br>
         Half gold half red, that one might know <br>
         The blood was ripe inside the core; <br>
         The colour of the leaves was more <br>
         Like stems of yellow corn that grow <br>
         Through all the gold June meadow's floor.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The warm smell of the fruit was good <br>
         To feed on, and the split green wood, <br>
         With all its bearded lips and stains <br>
         Of mosses in the cloven veins, <br>
         Most pleasant, if one lay or stood <br>
         In sunshine or in happy rains.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There were four apples on the tree, <br>
         Red stained through gold, that all might see <br>
         The sun went warm from core to rind; <br>
         The green leaves made the summer blind <br>
         In that soft place they kept for me <br>
         With golden apples shut behind.<br>
         
         
         <center>249<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The leaves caught gold across the sun, <br>
         And where the bluest air begun,<br>
         Thirsted for song to help the heat; <br>
         As I to feel my lady's feet <br>
         Draw close before the day were done; <br>
         Both lips grew dry with dreams of it.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In the mute August afternoon <br>
         They trembled to some undertune <br>
         Of music in the silver air; <br>
         Great pleasure was it to be there <br>
         Till green turned duskier and the moon <br>
         Coloured the corn-sheaves like gold hair.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         That August time it was delight <br>
         To watch the red moons wane to white <br>
         'Twixt grey seamed stems of apple-trees; <br>
         A sense of heavy harmonies <br>
         Grew on the growth of patient night, <br>
         More sweet than shapen music is.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But some three hours before the moon <br>
         The air, still eager from the noon, <br>
         Flagged after heat, not wholly dead; <br>
         Against the stem I leant my head; <br>
         The colour soothed me like a tune, <br>
         Green leaves all round the gold and red.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I lay there till the warm smell grew <br>
         More sharp, when flecks of yellow dew <br>
         
         <center>250<br></center>
         Between the round ripe leaves had blurred <br>
         The rind with stain and wet; I heard <br>
         A wind that blew and breathed and blew, <br>
         Too weak to alter its one word.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The wet leaves next the gentle fruit <br>
         Felt smoother, and the brown tree-root <br>
         Felt the mould warmer: I too felt <br>
         (As water feels the slow gold melt <br>
         Right through it when the day burns mute) <br>
         The peace of time wherein love dwelt.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There were four apples on the tree, <br>
         Gold stained on red that all might see <br>
         The sweet blood filled them to the core: <br>
         The colour of her hair is more <br>
         Like stems of fair faint gold, that be <br>
         Mown from the harvest's middle floor. <br>

         <h3>A CHRISTMAS CAROL.*
            
         </h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Three</span> damsels in the queen's chamber, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The queen's mouth was most fair; <br>
         She spake a word of God's mother <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As the combs went in her hair. <br>
         Mary that is of might, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's sight.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They held the gold combs out from her, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         A span's length off her head; <br>
         She sang this song of God's mother <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And of her bearing-bed. <br>
         Mary most full of grace, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's face.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         When she sat at Joseph's hand, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         She looked against her side; <br>
         And either way from the short silk band <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Her girdle was all wried. <br>
         Mary that all good may, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's way.<br>
         
         
         <center>252<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Mary had three women for her bed, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The twain were maidens clean; <br>
         The first of them had white and red, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The third had riven green. <br>
         Mary that is so sweet, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's feet.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She had three women for her hair, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Two were gloved soft and shod; <br>
         The third had feet and fingers bare, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         She was the likest God. <br>
         Mary that wieldeth land, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's hand.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She had three women for her ease, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The twain were good women: <br>
         The first two were the two Maries, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The third was Magdalen. <br>
         Mary that perfect is, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's kiss.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Joseph had three workmen in his stall, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To serve him well upon; <br>
         The first of them were Peter and Paul, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The third of them was John. <br>
         Mary, God's handmaiden, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's ken.<br>
         
         
         <center>253<br></center>
         <br><br>
         "If your child be none other man's, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But if it be very mine, <br>
         The bedstead shall be gold two spans, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The bedfoot silver fine." <br>
         Mary that made God mirth, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's birth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "If the child be some other man's, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And if it be none of mine, <br>
         The manger shall be straw two spans, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Betwixen kine and kine." <br>
         Mary that made sin cease, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's peace.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Christ was born upon this wise, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         It fell on such a night, <br>
         Neither with sounds of psalteries, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Nor with fire for light. <br>
         Mary that is God's spouse, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's house.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The star came out upon the east <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With a great sound and sweet: <br>
         Kings gave gold to make him feast <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And myrrh for him to eat. <br>
         Mary, of thy sweet mood, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's good.<br>
         
         
         <center>254<br></center>
         <br><br>
         He had two handmaids at his head, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         One handmaid at his feet; <br>
         The twain of them were fair and red, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The third one was right sweet. <br>
         Mary that is most wise, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's eyes. Amen.<br>

         <h3>THE MASQUE OF QUEEN BERSABE.</h3>
         
         <h3>A MIRACLE-PLAY.</h3>
         
         KING DAVID.
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Knights</span> mine, all that be in hall, <br>
         I have a counsel to you all, <br>
         Because of this thing God lets fall <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Among us for a sign. <br>
         For some days hence as I did eat <br>
         From kingly dishes my good meat, <br>
         There flew a bird between my feet <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As red as any wine. <br>
         This bird had a long bill of red <br>
         And a gold ring above his head; <br>
         Long time he sat and nothing said, <br>
         Put softly down his neck and fed <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         From the gilt patens fine: <br>
         And as I marvelled, at the last <br>
         He shut his two keen eyÃ«n fast <br>
         And suddenly woxe big and brast <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Ere one should tell to nine.<br>
         
         
         
         <center>256<br></center>
         
         PRIMUS MILES.
         <br><br>
         Sir, note this that I will say; <br>
         That Lord who maketh corn with hay <br>
         And morrows each of yesterday, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         He hath you in his hand.<br>
         
         
         
         SECUNDUS MILES (Paganus
         quidam).
         
         <br><br>
         By Satan I hold no such thing; <br>
         For if wine swell within a king <br>
         Whose ears for drink are hot and ring, <br>
         The same shall dream of wine-bibbing <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whilst he can lie or stand.<br>
         
         
         
         QUEEN BERSABE. 
         <br><br>
         Peace now, lords, for Godis head, <br>
         Ye chirk as starlings that be fed <br>
         And gape as fishes newly dead; <br>
         The devil put your bones to bed, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Lo, this is all to say.<br>
         
         
         
         SECUNDUS MILES. 
         <br><br>
         By Mahound, lords, I have good will <br>
         This devil's bird to wring and spill; <br>
         For now meseems our game goes ill, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Ye have scant hearts to play.<br>
         
         
         
         TERTIUS MILES. 
         <br><br>
         Lo, sirs, this word is there said, <br>
         That Urias the knight is dead <br>
         
         <center>257<br></center>
         Through some ill craft; by Poulis head, <br>
         I doubt his blood hath made so red <br>
         This bird that flew from the queen's bed <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whereof ye have such fear.<br>
         
         
         
         KING DAVID. 
         <br><br>
         Yea, my good knave, and is it said <br>
         That I can raise men from the dead? <br>
         By God I think to have his head <br>
         Who saith words of my lady's bed <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For any thief to hear. <br>
         
         
         Et percutiat eum in capite.
         
         QUEEN BERSABE. 
         <br><br>
         I wis men shall spit at me, <br>
         And say, it were but right for thee <br>
         That one should hang thee on a tree; <br>
         Ho! it were a fair thing to see <br>
         The big stones bruise her false body; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Fie! who shall see her dead?<br>
         
         
         
         KING DAVID. 
         <br><br>
         I rede you have no fear of this, <br>
         For, as ye wot, the first good kiss <br>
         I had must be the last of his; <br>
         Now are ye queen of mine, I wis, <br>
         And lady of a house that is <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Full rich of meat and bread.<br>
         
         
         
         <center>258<br></center>
         
         PRIMUS MILES. 
         <br><br>
         I bid you make good cheer to be <br>
         So fair a queen as all men see, <br>
         And hold us for your lieges free; <br>
         By Peter's soul that hath the key, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Ye have good hap of it.<br>
         
         
         
         SECUNDUS MILES. 
         <br><br>
         I would that he were hanged and dead <br>
         Who hath no joy to see your head <br>
         With gold about it, barred on red; <br>
         I hold him as a sow of lead <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That is so scant of wit.<br>
         
         
         
         
         Tunc dicat
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Nathan</span>
         propheta.
         
         <br><br>
         O king, I have a word to thee; <br>
         The child that is in Bersabe <br>
         Shall wither without light to see; <br>
         This word is come of God by me <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For sin that ye have done. <br>
         Because herein ye did not right, <br>
         To take the fair one lamb to smite <br>
         That was of Urias the knight; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Ye wist he had but one. <br>
         Full many sheep I wot ye had, <br>
         And many women, when ye bade, <br>
         To do your will and keep you glad; <br>
         And a good crown about your head <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With gold to show thereon. <br>
         
         <center>259<br></center>
         This Urias had one poor house <br>
         With low-barred latoun shot-windows <br>
         And scant of corn to fill a mouse; <br>
         And rusty basnets for his brows, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To wear them to the bone. <br>
         Yea the roofs also, as men sain, <br>
         Were thin to hold against the rain; <br>
         Therefore what rushes were there lain <br>
         Grew wet withouten foot of men; <br>
         The stancheons were all gone in twain <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As sick man's flesh is gone.<br>
         Nathless he had great joy to see <br>
         The long hair of this Bersabe <br>
         Fall round her lap and round her knee <br>
         Even to her small soft feet, that be <br>
         Shod now with crimson royally <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And covered with clean gold. <br>
         Likewise great joy he had to kiss <br>
         Her throat, where now the scarlet is <br>
         Against her little chin, I wis, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That then was but cold. <br>
         No scarlet then her kirtle had <br>
         And little gold about it sprad; <br>
         But her red mouth was alway glad <br>
         To kiss, albeit the eyes were sad <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With love they had to hold.<br>
         
         
         
         <center>260<br></center>
         
         SECUNDUS MILES. 
         <br><br>
         How! old thief, thy wits are lame; <br>
         To clip such it is no shame; <br>
         I rede you in the devil's name, <br>
         Ye come not here to make men game; <br>
         By Termagaunt that maketh grame, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         I shall to-bete thine head. <br>
         
         Hic Diabolus capiat eum.
         <br><br>
         This knave hath sharp fingers, perfay; <br>
         Mahound you thank and keep alway, <br>
         And give you good knees to pray; <br>
         What man hath no lust to play, <br>
         The devil wring his ears, I say; <br>
         There is no more but wellaway, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For now am I dead.<br>
         
         
         
         KING DAVID. 
         <br><br>
         Certes his mouth is wried and black, <br>
         Full little pence be in his sack; <br>
         This devil hath him by the back, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         It is no boot to lie.<br>
         
         
         
         NATHAN. 
         <br><br>
         Sitteth now still and learn of me; <br>
         A little while and ye shall see <br>
         The face of God's strength presently. <br>
         All queens made as this Bersabe, <br>
         
         <center>261<br></center>
         All that were fair and foul ye be, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Come hither; it am I.<br>
         
         
         Et hÃ¬c omnes cantabunt.
         
         HERODIAS. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Herodias. <br>
         This headband of my temples was <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         King Herod's gold band woven me. <br>
         This broken dry staff in my hand <br>
         Was the queen's staff of a great land <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Betwixen Perse and Samarie. <br>
         For that one dancing of my feet, <br>
         The fire is come in my green wheat, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         From one sea to the other sea.<br>
         
         
         
         AHOLIBAH. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Aholibah. <br>
         My lips kissed dumb the word of <i>Ah</i>
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Sighed on strange lips grown sick thereby. <br>
         God wrought to me my royal bed; <br>
         The inner work thereof was red, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The outer work was ivory.<br>
         My mouth's heat was the heat of flame <br>
         For lust towards the kings that came <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With horsemen riding royally.<br>
         
         
         
         CLEOPATRA. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Ethiope. <br>
         
         <center>262<br></center>
         Love bade my kissing eyelids ope <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That men beholding might praise love. <br>
         My hair was wonderful and curled; <br>
         My lips held fast the mouth o' the world <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To spoil the strength and speech thereof. <br>
         The latter triumph in my breath <br>
         Bowed down the beaten brows of death, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Ashamed they had not wrath enough.<br>
         
         
         
         ABIHAIL. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Tyrians. <br>
         My hair was glorious for twelve spans, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That dried to loose dust afterward. <br>
         My stature was a strong man's length; <br>
         My neck was like a place of strength <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Built with white walls, even and hard. <br>
         Like the first noise of rain leaves catch <br>
         One from another, snatch by snatch, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Is my praise, hissed against and marred.<br>
         
         
         
         AZUBAH. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Amorites. <br>
         My face was like a place of lights <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With multitudes at festival. <br>
         The glory of my gracious brows <br>
         Was like God's house made glorious <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With colours upon either wall.<br>
         Between my brows and hair there was <br>
         
         <center>263<br></center>
         A white space like a space of glass <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With golden candles over all.<br>
         
         
         
         AHOLAH. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Amalek. <br>
         There was no tender touch or fleck <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To spoil my body or bared feet. <br>
         My words were soft like dulcimers, <br>
         And the first sweet of grape-flowers <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Made each side of my bosom sweet. <br>
         My raiment was as tender fruit <br>
         Whose rind smells sweet of spice-tree root, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Bruised balm-blossom and budded wheat.<br>
         
         
         
         AHINOAM. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Ahinoam. <br>
         Like the throat of a soft slain lamb <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Was my throat, softer veined than his: <br>
         My lips were as two grapes the sun <br>
         Lays his whole weight of heat upon <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Like a mouth heavy with a kiss: <br>
         My hair's pure purple a wrought fleece, <br>
         My temples therein as a piece <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Of a pomegranate's cleaving is.<br>
         
         
         
         ATARAH. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Sidonian. <br>
         My face made faint the face of man, <br>
         
         <center>264<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And strength was bound between my brows. <br>
         Spikenard was hidden in my ships, <br>
         Honey and wheat and myrrh in strips, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         White wools that shine as colour does,<br>
         Soft linen dyed upon the fold, <br>
         Split spice and cores of scented gold, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Cedar and broken calamus.<br>
         
         
         
         SEMIRAMIS. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Semiramis. <br>
         The whole world and the sea that is <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         In fashion like a chrysopras, <br>
         The noise of all men labouring, <br>
         The priest's mouth tired through thanksgiving, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The sound of love in the blood's pause, <br>
         The strength of love in the blood's beat, <br>
         All these were cast beneath my feet <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And all found lesser than I was.<br>
         
         
         
         HESIONE. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Hesione. <br>
         The seasons that increased in me <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Made my face fairer than all men's. <br>
         I had the summer in my hair; <br>
         And all the pale gold autumn air <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Was as the habit of my sense. <br>
         My body was as fire that shone; <br>
         God's beauty that makes all things one <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Was one among my handmaidens.<br>
         
         
         
         <center>265<br></center>
         
         CHRYSOTHEMIS. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Samothrace. <br>
         God, making roses, made my face <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As a rose filled up full with red. <br>
         My prows made sharp the straitened seas <br>
         From Pontus to that Chersonese <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whereon the ebbed Asian stream is shed.<br>
         My hair was as sweet scent that drips; <br>
         Love's breath begun about my lips <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Kindled the lips of people dead.<br>
         
         
         
         THOMYRIS. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Scythians. <br>
         My strength was like no strength of man's, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         My face like day, my breast like spring. <br>
         My fame was felt in the extreme land <br>
         That hath sunshine on the one hand <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And on the other star-shining. <br>
         Yea, and the wind there fails of breath; <br>
         Yea, and there life is waste like death; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Yea, and there death is a glad thing.<br>
         
         
         
         HARHAS. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Anakim. <br>
         In the spent years whose speech is dim, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whose raiment is the dust and death, <br>
         My stately body without stain <br>
         Shone as the shining race of rain <br>
         
         <center>266<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whose hair a great wind scattereth. <br>
         Now hath God turned my lips to sighs, <br>
         Plucked off mine eyelids from mine eyes, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And sealed with seals my way of breath.<br>
         
         
         
         MYRRHA. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Arabian. <br>
         The tears wherewith mine eyelids ran <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Smelt like my perfumed eyelids' smell. <br>
         A harsh thirst made my soft mouth hard, <br>
         That ached with kisses afterward; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         My brain rang like a beaten bell.<br>
         As tears on eyes, as fire on wood, <br>
         Sin fed upon my breath and blood, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Sin made my breasts subside and swell.<br>
         
         
         
         PASIPHAE. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Pasiphae. <br>
         Not all the pure clean-coloured sea <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Could cleanse or cool my yearning veins; <br>
         Nor any root nor herb that grew, <br>
         Flag-leaves that let green water through, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Nor washing of the dews and rains. <br>
         From shame's pressed core I wrung the sweet <br>
         Fruit's savour that was death to eat, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whereof no seed but death remains.<br>
         
         
         
         <center>267<br></center>
         
         SAPPHO. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Lesbians. <br>
         My love, that had no part in man's, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Was sweeter than all shape of sweet. <br>
         The intolerable infinite desire <br>
         Made my face pale like faded fire <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         When the ashen pyre falls through with heat. <br>
         My blood was hot wan wine of love, <br>
         And my song's sound the sound thereof, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The sound of the delight of it.<br>
         
         
         
         MESSALINA. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Italy. <br>
         These were the signs God set on me; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         A barren beauty subtle and sleek, <br>
         Curled carven hair, and cheeks worn wan <br>
         With fierce false lips of many a man, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Large temples where the blood ran weak,<br>
         A mouth athirst and amorous <br>
         And hungering as the grave's mouth does <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That, being an-hungred, cannot speak.<br>
         
         
         
         AMESTRIS. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Persians. <br>
         My breasts were lordlier than bright swans, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         My body as amber fair and thin. <br>
         Strange flesh was given my lips for bread, <br>
         With poisonous hours my days were fed, <br>
         
         <center>268<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And my feet shod with adder-skin. <br>
         In Shushan toward Ecbatane <br>
         I wrought my joys with tears and pain, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         My loves with blood and bitter sin.<br>
         
         
         
         EPHRATH. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Rephaim. <br>
         God, that some while refraineth him, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Made in the end a spoil of me. <br>
         My rumour was upon the world <br>
         As strong sound of swoln water hurled <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Through porches of the straining sea. <br>
         My hair was like the flag-flower, <br>
         And my breasts carven goodlier <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Than beryl with chalcedony.<br>
         
         
         
         PASITHEA. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Cypriotes. <br>
         Mine oarsmen, labouring with brown throats, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Sang of me many a tender thing. <br>
         My maidens, girdled loose and braced <br>
         With gold from bosom to white waist, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Praised me between their wool-combing.<br>
         All that praise Venus all night long <br>
         With lips like speech and lids like song <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Praised me till song lost heart to sing.<br>
         
         
         
         <center>269<br></center>
         
         ALACIEL. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Alaciel. <br>
         My mouth was like that moist gold cell <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whereout the thickest honey drips. <br>
         Mine eyes were as a grey-green sea; <br>
         The amorous blood that smote on me <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Smote to my feet and finger-tips. <br>
         My throat was whiter than the dove, <br>
         Mine eyelids as the seals of love, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And as the doors of love my lips.<br>
         
         
         
         ERIGONE. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Erigone. <br>
         The wild wine shed as blood on me <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Made my face brighter than a bride's. <br>
         My large lips had the old thirst of earth, <br>
         Mine arms the might of the old sea's girth <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Bound round the whole world's iron sides. <br>
         Within mine eyes and in mine ears <br>
         Were music and the wine of tears, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And light, and thunder of the tides. <br>
         
         Et hÃ¬c exeant, et dicat Bersabe regina;
         <br><br>
         Alas, God, for thy great pity <br>
         And for the might that is in thee, <br>
         Behold, I woful Bersabe <br>
         Cry out with stoopings of my knee <br>
         And thy wrath laid and bound on me <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Till I may see thy love.<br>
         
         <center>270<br></center>
         Behold, Lord, this child is grown <br>
         Within me between bone and bone <br>
         To make me mother of a son, <br>
         Made of my body with strong moan; <br>
         There shall not be another one <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That shall be made hereof.<br>
         
         
         
         KING DAVID. 
         <br><br>
         Lord God, alas, what shall I sain? <br>
         Lo, thou art as an hundred men <br>
         Both to break and build again: <br>
         The wild ways thou makest plain, <br>
         Thine hands hold the hail and rain, <br>
         And thy fingers both grape and grain; <br>
         Of their largess we be all well fain, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And of their great pity: <br>
         The sun thou madest of good gold, <br>
         Of clean silver the moon cold, <br>
         All the great stars thou hast told <br>
         As thy cattle in thy fold <br>
         Every one by his name of old; <br>
         Wind and water thou hast in hold, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Both the land and the long sea; <br>
         Both the green sea and the land, <br>
         Lord God, thou hast in hand, <br>
         Both white water and grey sand; <br>
         Upon thy right or thy left hand <br>
         There is no man that may stand; <br>
         
         <center>271<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Lord, thou rue on me. <br>
         O wise Lord, if thou be keen <br>
         To note things amiss that been, <br>
         I am not worth a shell of bean <br>
         More than an old mare meagre and lean;<br>
         For all my wrong-doing with my queen, <br>
         It grew not of our heartÃ¨s clean, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But it began of her body. <br>
         For it fell in the hot May <br>
         I stood within a paven way <br>
         Built of fair bright stone, perfay, <br>
         That is as fire of night and day <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And lighteth all my house. <br>
         Therein be neither stones nor sticks, <br>
         Neither red nor white bricks, <br>
         But for cubits five or six <br>
         There is most goodly sardonyx <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And amber laid in rows. <br>
         It goes round about my roofs, <br>
         (If ye list ye shall have proofs) <br>
         There is good space for horse and hoofs, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Plain and nothing perilous. <br>
         For the fair green weather's heat, <br>
         And for the smell of leavÃ¨s sweet, <br>
         It is no marvel, well ye weet, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         A man to waxen amorous. <br>
         This I say now by my case <br>
         That spied forth of that royal place; <br>
         
         <center>272<br></center>
         There I saw in no great space <br>
         Mine own sweet, both body and face, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Under the fresh boughs. <br>
         In a water that was there <br>
         She wesshe her goodly body bare <br>
         And dried it with her owen hair: <br>
         Both her arms and her knees fair, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Both bosom and brows; <br>
         Both shoulders and eke thighs <br>
         Tho she wesshe upon this wise; <br>
         Ever she sighed with little sighs, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And ever she gave God thank.<br>
         Yea, God wot I can well see yet <br>
         Both her breast and her sides all wet <br>
         And her long hair withouten let <br>
         Spread sideways like a drawing net; <br>
         Full dear bought and full far fet <br>
         Was that sweet thing there y-set; <br>
         It were a hard thing to forget <br>
         How both lips and eyen met, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Breast and breath sank. <br>
         So goodly a sight as there she was, <br>
         Lying looking on her glass <br>
         By wan water in green grass, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Yet saw never man. <br>
         So soft and great she was and bright <br>
         With all her body waxen white, <br>
         I woxe nigh blind to see the light <br>
         
         <center>273<br></center>
         Shed out of it to left and right; <br>
         This bitter sin from that sweet sight <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Between us twain began.<br>
         
         
         
         NATHAN. 
         <br><br>
         Now, sir, be merry anon, <br>
         For ye shall have a full wise son, <br>
         Goodly and great of flesh and bone; <br>
         There shall no king be such an one, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         I swear by Godis rood. <br>
         Therefore, lord, be merry here, <br>
         And go to meat withouten fear, <br>
         And hear a mass with goodly cheer; <br>
         For to all folk ye shall be dear, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And all folk of your blood. <br>
         
         
         Et tunc dicant Laudamus.

         <h3>ST. DOROTHY</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">It </span>hath been seen and yet it shall be seen <br>
         That out of tender mouths God's praise hath been <br>
         Made perfect, and with wood and simple string <br>
         He hath played music sweet as shawm-playing <br>
         To please himself with softness of all sound; <br>
         And no small thing but hath been sometime found <br>
         Full sweet of use, and no such humbleness <br>
         But God hath bruised withal the sentences <br>
         And evidence of wise men witnessing; <br>
         No leaf that is so soft a hidden thing <br>
         It never shall get sight of the great sun; <br>
         The strength of ten has been the strength of one, <br>
         And lowliness has waxed imperious.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There was in Rome a man Theophilus <br>
         Of right great blood and gracious ways, that had <br>
         All noble fashions to make people glad <br>
         And a soft life of pleasurable days; <br>
         He was a goodly man for one to praise, <br>
         Flawless and whole upward from foot to head; <br>
         His arms were a red hawk that alway fed <br>
         
         <center>275<br></center>
         On a small bird with feathers gnawed upon, <br>
         Beaten and plucked about the bosom-bone <br>
         Whereby a small round fleck like fire there was: <br>
         They called it in their tongue lampadias;<br>
         This was the banner of the lordly man. <br>
         In many straits of sea and reaches wan <br>
         Full of quick wind, and many a shaken firth, <br>
         It had seen fighting days of either earth, <br>
         Westward or east of waters Gaditane <br>
         (This was the place of sea-rocks under Spain <br>
         Called after the great praise of Hercules) <br>
         And north beyond the washing Pontic seas, <br>
         Far windy Russian places fabulous, <br>
         And salt fierce tides of storm-swoln Bosphorus.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Now as this lord came straying in Rome town <br>
         He saw a little lattice open down <br>
         And after it a press of maidens' heads <br>
         That sat upon their cold small quiet beds <br>
         Talking, and played upon short-stringÃ¨d lutes; <br>
         And other some ground perfume out of roots <br>
         Gathered by marvellous moons in Asia; <br>
         Saffron and aloes and wild cassia, <br>
         Coloured all through and smelling of the sun; <br>
         And over all these was a certain one <br>
         Clothed softly, with sweet herbs about her hair <br>
         And bosom flowerful; her face more fair <br>
         Than sudden-singing April in soft lands: <br>
         Eyed like a gracious bird, and in both hands <br>
         
         <center>276<br></center>
         She held a psalter painted green and red.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This Theophile laughed at the heart, and said, <br>
         Now God so help me hither and St. Paul, <br>
         As by the new time of their festival <br>
         I have good will to take this maid to wife. <br>
         And herewith fell to fancies of her life <br>
         And soft half-thoughts that ended suddenly. <br>
         This is man's guise to please himself, when he <br>
         Shall not see one thing of his pleasant things, <br>
         Nor with outwatch of many travailings<br>
         Come to be eased of the least pain he hath <br>
         For all his love and all his foolish wrath <br>
         And all the heavy manner of his mind. <br>
         Thus is he like a fisher fallen blind <br>
         That casts his nets across the boat awry <br>
         To strike the sea, but lo, he striketh dry <br>
         And plucks them back all broken for his pain <br>
         And bites his beard and casts across again <br>
         And reaching wrong slips over in the sea. <br>
         So hath this man a strangled neck for fee, <br>
         For all his cost he chuckles in his throat.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This Theophile that little hereof wote <br>
         Laid wait to hear of her what she might be: <br>
         Men told him she had name of Dorothy, <br>
         And was a lady of a worthy house. <br>
         Thereat this knight grew inly glorious <br>
         That he should have a love so fair of place. <br>
         She was a maiden of most quiet face, <br>
         
         <center>277<br></center>
         Tender of speech, and had no hardihood <br>
         But was nigh feeble of her fearful blood; <br>
         Her mercy in her was so marvellous <br>
         From her least years, that seeing her school-fellows <br>
         That read beside her stricken with a rod, <br>
         She would cry sore and say some word to God <br>
         That he would ease her fellow of his pain. <br>
         There is no touch of sun or fallen rain <br>
         That ever fell on a more gracious thing.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In middle Rome there was in stone-working <br>
         The church of Venus painted royally. <br>
         The chapels of it were some two or three, <br>
         In each of them her tabernacle was <br>
         And a wide window of six feet in glass <br>
         Coloured with all her works in red and gold. <br>
         The altars had bright cloths and cups to hold<br>
         The wine of Venus for the services, <br>
         Made out of honey and crushed wood-berries <br>
         That shed sweet yellow through the thick wet red, <br>
         That on high days was borne upon the head <br>
         Of Venus' priest for any man to drink; <br>
         So that in drinking he should fall to think <br>
         On some fair face, and in the thought thereof <br>
         Worship, and such should triumph in his love. <br>
         For this soft wine that did such grace and good <br>
         Was new trans-shaped and mixed with Love's own blood, <br>
         That in the fighting Trojan time was bled; <br>
         For which came such a woe to Diomed <br>
         
         <center>278<br></center>
         That he was stifled after in hard sea. <br>
         And some said that this wine-shedding should be <br>
         Made of the falling of Adonis' blood, <br>
         That curled upon the thorns and broken wood <br>
         And round the gold silk shoes on Venus' feet; <br>
         The taste thereof was as hot honey sweet, <br>
         And in the mouth ran soft and riotous. <br>
         This was the holiness of Venus' house.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         It was their worship, that in August days <br>
         Twelve maidens should go through those Roman ways <br>
         Naked, and having gold across their brows <br>
         And their hair twisted in short golden rows, <br>
         To minister to Venus in this wise: <br>
         And twelve men chosen in their companies <br>
         To match these maidens by the altar-stair, <br>
         All in one habit, crowned upon the hair. <br>
         Among these men was chosen Theophile.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This knight went out and prayed a little while, <br>
         Holding queen Venus by her hands and knees; <br>
         I will give thee twelve royal images<br>
         Cut in glad gold, with marvels of wrought stone <br>
         For thy sweet priests to lean and pray upon, <br>
         Jasper and hyacinth and chrysopras, <br>
         And the strange Asian thalamite that was <br>
         Hidden twelve ages under heavy sea <br>
         Among the little sleepy pearls, to be <br>
         A shrine lit over with soft candle-flame <br>
         Burning all night red as hot brows of shame, <br>
         
         <center>279<br></center>
         So thou wilt be my lady without sin. <br>
         Goddess that art all gold outside and in, <br>
         Help me to serve thee in thy holy way. <br>
         Thou knowest, Love, that in my bearing day <br>
         There shone a laughter in the singing stars <br>
         Round the gold-ceilÃ¨d bride-bed wherein Mars <br>
         Touched thee and had thee in your kissing wise. <br>
         Now therefore, sweet, kiss thou my maiden's eyes <br>
         That they may open graciously towards me; <br>
         And this new fashion of thy shrine shall be <br>
         As soft with gold as thine own happy head.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The goddess, that was painted with face red <br>
         Between two long green tumbled sides of sea, <br>
         Stooped her neck sideways, and spake pleasantly: <br>
         Thou shalt have grace as thou art thrall of mine. <br>
         And with this came a savour of shed wine <br>
         And plucked-out petals from a rose's head: <br>
         And softly with slow laughs of lip she said, <br>
         Thou shalt have favour all thy days of me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then came Theophilus to Dorothy, <br>
         Saying: O sweet, if one should strive or speak <br>
         Against God's ways, he gets a beaten cheek <br>
         For all his wage and shame above all men. <br>
         Therefore I have no will to turn again <br>
         When God saith ``go,'' lest a worse thing fall out. <br>
         Then she, misdoubting lest he went about<br>
         To catch her wits, made answer somewhat thus: <br>
         I have no will, my lord Theophilus, <br>
         
         <center>280<br></center>
         To speak against this worthy word of yours; <br>
         Knowing how God's will in all speech endures, <br>
         That save by grace there may no thing be said. <br>
         Then Theophile waxed light from foot to head, <br>
         And softly fell upon this answering. <br>
         It is well seen you are a chosen thing <br>
         To do God service in his gracious way. <br>
         I will that you make haste and holiday <br>
         To go next year upon the Venus stair, <br>
         Covered none else, but crowned upon your hair, <br>
         And do the service that a maiden doth. <br>
         She said: but I that am Christ's maid were loth <br>
         To do this thing that hath such bitter name. <br>
         Thereat his brows were beaten with sore shame <br>
         And he came off and said no other word. <br>
         Then his eyes chanced upon his banner-bird, <br>
         And he fell fingering at the staff of it <br>
         And laughed for wrath and stared between his feet, <br>
         And out of a chafed heart he spake as thus: <br>
         Lo how she japes at me Theophilus, <br>
         Feigning herself a fool and hard to love; <br>
         Yet in good time for all she boasteth of <br>
         She shall be like a little beaten bird. <br>
         And while his mouth was open in that word <br>
         He came upon the house Janiculum, <br>
         Where some went busily, and other some <br>
         Talked in the gate called the gate glorious. <br>
         The emperor, which was one Gabalus, <br>
         
         <center>281<br></center>
         Sat over all and drank chill wine alone. <br>
         To whom is come Theophilus anon, <br>
         And said as thus: <i>Beau sire, Dieu vous aide</i>. <br>
         And afterward sat under him, and said<br>
         All this thing through as ye have wholly heard.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This Gabalus laughed thickly in his beard. <br>
         Yea, this is righteousness and maiden rule. <br>
         Truly, he said, a maid is but a fool. <br>
         And japed at them as one full villainous, <br>
         In a lewd wise, this heathen Gabalus, <br>
         And sent his men to bind her as he bade. <br>
         Thus have they taken Dorothy the maid, <br>
         And haled her forth as men hale pick-purses: <br>
         A little need God knows they had of this, <br>
         To hale her by her maiden gentle hair. <br>
         Thus went she lowly, making a soft prayer, <br>
         As one who stays the sweet wine in his mouth, <br>
         Murmuring with eased lips, and is most loth <br>
         To have done wholly with the sweet of it.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Christ king, fair Christ, that knowest all men's wit <br>
         And all the feeble fashion of my ways, <br>
         O perfect God, that from all yesterdays <br>
         Abidest whole with morrows perfected, <br>
         I pray thee by thy mother's holy head <br>
         Thou help me to do right, that I not slip: <br>
         I have no speech nor strength upon my lip, <br>
         Except thou help me who art wise and sweet. <br>
         Do this too for those nails that clove thy feet, <br>
         
         <center>282<br></center>
         Let me die maiden after many pains. <br>
         Though I be least among thy handmaidens, <br>
         Doubtless I shall take death more sweetly thus.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Now have they brought her to King Gabalus, <br>
         Who laughed in all his throat some breathing-whiles: <br>
         By God, he said, if one should leap two miles, <br>
         He were not pained about the sides so much. <br>
         This were a soft thing for a man to touch.<br>
         Shall one so chafe that hath such little bones? <br>
         And shook his throat with thick and chuckled moans <br>
         For laughter that she had such holiness. <br>
         What aileth thee, wilt thou do services? <br>
         It were good fare to fare as Venus doth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then said this lady with her maiden mouth, <br>
         Shamefaced, and something paler in the cheek: <br>
         Now, sir, albeit my wit and will to speak <br>
         Give me no grace in sight of worthy men, <br>
         For all my shame yet know I this again, <br>
         I may not speak, nor after downlying <br>
         Rise up to take delight in lute-playing, <br>
         Nor sing nor sleep, nor sit and fold my hands, <br>
         But my soul in some measure understands <br>
         God's grace laid like a garment over me. <br>
         For this fair God that out of strong sharp sea <br>
         Lifted the shapely and green-coloured land, <br>
         And hath the weight of heaven in his hand <br>
         As one might hold a bird, and under him <br>
         The heavy golden planets beam by beam <br>
         
         <center>283<br></center>
         Building the feasting-chambers of his house, <br>
         And the large world he holdeth with his brows <br>
         And with the light of them astonisheth <br>
         All place and time and face of life and death <br>
         And motion of the north wind and the south, <br>
         And is the sound within his angel's mouth <br>
         Of singing words and words of thanksgiving, <br>
         And is the colour of the latter spring <br>
         And heat upon the summer and the sun, <br>
         And is beginning of all things begun <br>
         And gathers in him all things to their end, <br>
         And with the fingers of his hand doth bend <br>
         The stretched-out sides of heaven like a sail, <br>
         And with his breath he maketh the red pale<br>
         And fills with blood faint faces of men dead, <br>
         And with the sound between his lips are fed <br>
         Iron and fire and the white body of snow, <br>
         And blossom of all trees in places low, <br>
         And small bright herbs about the little hills, <br>
         And fruit pricked softly with birds' tender bills, <br>
         And flight of foam about green fields of sea, <br>
         And fourfold strength of the great winds that be <br>
         Moved always outward from beneath his feet, <br>
         And growth of grass and growth of sheavÃ¨d wheat <br>
         And all green flower of goodly-growing lands; <br>
         And all these things he gathers with his hands <br>
         And covers all their beauty with his wings; <br>
         The same, even God that governs all these things, <br>
         
         <center>284<br></center>
         Hath set my feet to be upon his ways. <br>
         Now therefore for no painfulness of days <br>
         I shall put off this service bound on me. <br>
         Also, fair sir, ye know this certainly, <br>
         How God was in his flesh full chaste and meek <br>
         And gave his face to shame, and either cheek <br>
         Gave up to smiting of men tyrannous.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And here with a great voice this Gabalus <br>
         Cried out and said: By God's blood and his bones, <br>
         This were good game betwixen night and nones <br>
         For one to sit and hearken to such saws: <br>
         I were as lief fall in some big beast's jaws <br>
         As hear these women's jaw-teeth chattering; <br>
         By God a woman is the harder thing, <br>
         One may not put a hook into her mouth. <br>
         Now by St. Luke I am so sore adrouth <br>
         For all these saws I must needs drink again. <br>
         But I pray God deliver all us men <br>
         From all such noise of women and their heat. <br>
         That is a noble scripture, well I weet,<br>
         That likens women to an empty can; <br>
         When God said that he was a full wise man. <br>
         I trow no man may blame him as for that.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And herewithal he drank a draught, and spat, <br>
         And said: Now shall I make an end hereof. <br>
         Come near all men and hearken for God's love, <br>
         And ye shall hear a jest or twain, God wot. <br>
         And spake as thus with mouth full thick and hot; <br>
         
         <center>285<br></center>
         But thou do this thou shalt be shortly slain. <br>
         Lo, sir, she said, this death and all his pain <br>
         I take in penance of my bitter sins. <br>
         Yea now, quoth Gabalus, this game begins. <br>
         Lo, without sin one shall not live a span. <br>
         Lo, this is she that would not look on man <br>
         Between her fingers folded in thwart wise. <br>
         See how her shame hath smitten in her eyes <br>
         That was so clean she had not heard of shame. <br>
         Certes, he said, by Gabalus my name, <br>
         This two years back I was not so well pleased. <br>
         This were good mirth for sick men to be eased <br>
         And rise up whole and laugh at hearing of. <br>
         I pray thee show us something of thy love, <br>
         Since thou wast maid thy gown is waxen wide. <br>
         Yea, maid I am, she said, and somewhat sighed, <br>
         As one who thought upon the low fair house <br>
         Where she sat working, with soft bended brows <br>
         Watching her threads, among the school-maidens. <br>
         And she thought well now God had brought her thence <br>
         She should not come to sew her gold again.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then cried King Gabalus upon his men <br>
         To have her forth and draw her with steel gins. <br>
         And as a man hag-ridden beats and grins <br>
         And bends his body sidelong in his bed, <br>
         So wagged he with his body and knave's head,<br>
         Gaping at her, and blowing with his breath. <br>
         And in good time he gat an evil death <br>
         
         <center>286<br></center>
         Out of his lewdness with his cursÃ¨d wives: <br>
         His bones were hewn asunder as with knives <br>
         For his misliving, certes it is said. <br>
         But all the evil wrought upon this maid, <br>
         It were full hard for one to handle it. <br>
         For her soft blood was shed upon her feet, <br>
         And all her body's colour bruised and faint. <br>
         But she, as one abiding God's great saint, <br>
         Spake not nor wept for all this travail hard. <br>
         Wherefore the king commanded afterward <br>
         To slay her presently in all men's sight. <br>
         And it was now an hour upon the night <br>
         And winter-time, and a few stars began. <br>
         The weather was yet feeble and all wan <br>
         For beating of a weighty wind and snow. <br>
         And she came walking in soft wise and slow, <br>
         And many men with faces piteous. <br>
         Then came this heavy cursing Gabalus, <br>
         That swore full hard into his drunken beard; <br>
         And faintly after without any word <br>
         Came Theophile some paces off the king. <br>
         And in the middle of this wayfaring <br>
         Full tenderly beholding her he said:<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There is no word of comfort with men dead <br>
         Nor any face and colour of things sweet; <br>
         But always with lean cheeks and lifted feet <br>
         These dead men lie all aching to the blood <br>
         With bitter cold, their brows withouten hood <br>
         
         <center>287<br></center>
         Beating for chill, their bodies swathed full thin: <br>
         Alas, what hire shall any have herein <br>
         To give his life and get such bitterness? <br>
         Also the soul going forth bodiless<br>
         Is hurt with naked cold, and no man saith <br>
         If there be house or covering for death <br>
         To hide the soul that is discomforted.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then she beholding him a little said: <br>
         Alas, fair lord, ye have no wit of this; <br>
         For on one side death is full poor of bliss <br>
         And as ye say full sharp of bone and lean: <br>
         But on the other side is good and green <br>
         And hath soft flower of tender-coloured hair <br>
         Grown on his head, and a red mouth as fair <br>
         As may be kissed with lips; thereto his face <br>
         Is as God's face, and in a perfect place <br>
         Full of all sun and colour of straight boughs <br>
         And waterheads about a painted house <br>
         That hath a mile of flowers either way <br>
         Outward from it, and blossom-grass of May <br>
         Thickening on many a side for length of heat, <br>
         Hath God set death upon a noble seat <br>
         Covered with green and flowered in the fold, <br>
         In likeness of a great king grown full old <br>
         And gentle with new temperance of blood; <br>
         And on his brows a purfled purple hood, <br>
         They may not carry any golden thing; <br>
         And plays some tune with subtle fingering <br>
         
         <center>288<br></center>
         On a small cithern, full of tears and sleep <br>
         And heavy pleasure that is quick to weep <br>
         And sorrow with the honey in her mouth; <br>
         And for this might of music that he doth <br>
         Are all souls drawn toward him with great love <br>
         And weep for sweetness of the noise thereof <br>
         And bow to him with worship of their knees; <br>
         And all the field is thick with companies <br>
         Of fair-clothed men that play on shawms and lutes <br>
         And gather honey of the yellow fruits<br>
         Between the branches waxen soft and wide: <br>
         And all this peace endures in either side <br>
         Of the green land, and God beholdeth all. <br>
         And this is girdled with a round fair wall <br>
         Made of red stone and cool with heavy leaves <br>
         Grown out against it, and green blossom cleaves <br>
         To the green chinks, and lesser wall-weed sweet, <br>
         Kissing the crannies that are split with heat, <br>
         And branches where the summer draws to head.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And Theophile burnt in the cheek, and said: <br>
         Yea, could one see it, this were marvellous. <br>
         I pray you, at your coming to this house, <br>
         Give me some leaf of all those tree-branches; <br>
         Seeing how so sharp and white our weather is, <br>
         There is no green nor gracious red to see.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yea, sir, she said, that shall I certainly. <br>
         And from her long sweet throat without a fleck <br>
         Undid the gold, and through her stretched-out neck <br>
         
         <center>289<br></center>
         The cold axe clove, and smote away her head. <br>
         Out of her throat the tender blood full red <br>
         Fell suddenly through all her long soft hair. <br>
         And with good speed for hardness of the air <br>
         Each man departed to his house again.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lo, as fair colour in the face of men <br>
         At seed-time of their blood, or in such wise <br>
         As a thing seen increaseth in men's eyes, <br>
         Caught first far off by sickly fits of sightâ <br>
         So a word said, if one shall hear aright, <br>
         Abides against the season of its growth. <br>
         This Theophile went slowly as one doth <br>
         That is not sure for sickness of his feet; <br>
         And counting the white stonework of the street, <br>
         Tears fell out of his eyes for wrath and love, <br>
         Making him weep more for the shame thereof<br>
         Than for true pain: so went he half a mile. <br>
         And women mocked him, saying: Theophile, <br>
         Lo, she is dead; what shall a woman have <br>
         That loveth such an one? so Christ me save, <br>
         I were as lief to love a man new-hung. <br>
         Surely this man has bitten on his tongue, <br>
         This makes him sad and writhled in his face.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And when they came upon the paven place <br>
         That was called sometime the place amorous, <br>
         There came a child before Theophilus <br>
         Bearing a basket, and said suddenly: <br>
         Fair sir, this is my mistress Dorothy <br>
         
         <center>290<br></center>
         That sends you gifts; and with this he was gone. <br>
         In all this earth there is not such an one <br>
         For colour and straight stature made so fair. <br>
         The tender growing gold of his pure hair <br>
         Was as wheat growing, and his mouth as flame. <br>
         God called him Holy after his own name; <br>
         With gold cloth like fire burning he was clad. <br>
         But for the fair green basket that he had, <br>
         It was filled up with heavy white and red; <br>
         Great roses stained still where the first rose bled, <br>
         Burning at heart for shame their heart withholds: <br>
         And the sad colour of strong marigolds <br>
         That have the sun to kiss their lips for love; <br>
         The flower that Venus' hair is woven of, <br>
         The colour of fair apples in the sun, <br>
         Late peaches gathered when the heat was done <br>
         And the slain air got breath; and after these <br>
         The fair faint-headed poppies drunk with ease, <br>
         And heaviness of hollow lilies red.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then cried they all that saw these things, and said <br>
         It was God's doing, and was marvellous. <br>
         And in brief while this knight Theophilus<br>
         Is waxen full of faith, and witnesseth <br>
         Before the king of God and love and death, <br>
         For which the king bade hang him presently. <br>
         A gallows of a goodly piece of tree <br>
         This Gabalus hath made to hang him on. <br>
         Forth of this world lo Theophile is gone <br>
         
         <center>291<br></center>
         With a wried neck, God give us better fare <br>
         Than his that hath a twisted throat to wear; <br>
         But truly for his love God hath him brought <br>
         There where his heavy body grieves him nought <br>
         Nor all the people plucking at his feet; <br>
         But in his face his lady's face is sweet, <br>
         And through his lips her kissing lips are gone: <br>
         God send him peace, and joy of such an one.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This is the story of St. Dorothy. <br>
         I will you of your mercy pray for me <br>
         Because I wrote these sayings for your grace, <br>
         That I may one day see her in the face.<br>

         <h3>THE TWO DREAMS.</h3>
         
         <h3>(FROM BOCCACCIO).</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">I will</span> that if I say a heavy thing <br>
         Your tongues forgive me; seeing ye know that spring <br>
         Has flecks and fits of pain to keep her sweet, <br>
         And walks somewhile with winter-bitten feet. <br>
         Moreover it sounds often well to let <br>
         One string, when ye play music, keep at fret <br>
         The whole song through; one petal that is dead <br>
         Confirms the roses, be they white or red; <br>
         Dead sorrow is not sorrowful to hear <br>
         As the thick noise that breaks mid weeping were; <br>
         The sick sound aching in a lifted throat <br>
         Turns to sharp silver of a perfect note; <br>
         And though the rain falls often, and with rain <br>
         Late autumn falls on the old red leaves like pain, <br>
         I deem that God is not disquieted. <br>
         Also while men are fed with wine and bread, <br>
         They shall be fed with sorrow at his hand.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There grew a rose-garden in Florence land <br>
         More fair than many; all red summers through <br>
         The leaves smelt sweet and sharp of rain, and blew <br>
         
         <center>293<br></center>
         Sideways with tender wind; and therein fell <br>
         Sweet sound wherewith the green waxed audible,<br>
         As a bird's will to sing disturbed his throat <br>
         And set the sharp wings forward like a boat <br>
         Pushed through soft water, moving his brown side <br>
         Smooth-shapen as a maid's, and shook with pride <br>
         His deep warm bosom, till the heavy sun's <br>
         Set face of heat stopped all the songs at once. <br>
         The ways were clean to walk and delicate; <br>
         And when the windy white of March grew late, <br>
         Before the trees took heart to face the sun <br>
         With ravelled raiment of lean winter on, <br>
         The roots were thick and hot with hollow grass.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Some roods away a lordly house there was, <br>
         Cool with broad courts and latticed passage wet <br>
         From rush-flowers and lilies ripe to set, <br>
         Sown close among the strewings of the floor; <br>
         And either wall of the slow corridor <br>
         Was dim with deep device of gracious things; <br>
         Some angel's steady mouth and weight of wings <br>
         Shut to the side; or Peter with straight stole <br>
         And beard cut black against the aureole <br>
         That spanned his head from nape to crown; thereby <br>
         Mary's gold hair, thick to the girdle-tie <br>
         Wherein was bound a child with tender feet; <br>
         Or the broad cross with blood nigh brown on it.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Within this house a righteous lord abode <br>
         Ser Averardo; patient of his mood, <br>
         
         <center>294<br></center>
         And just of judgment; and to child he had <br>
         A maid so sweet that her mere sight made glad <br>
         Men sorrowing, and unbound the brows of hate; <br>
         And where she came, the lips that pain made strait <br>
         Waxed warm and wide, and from untender grew <br>
         Tender as those that sleep brings patience to. <br>
         Such long locks had she, that with knee to chin <br>
         She might have wrapped and warmed her feet therein.<br>
         Right seldom fell her face on weeping wise; <br>
         Gold hair she had, and golden-coloured eyes, <br>
         Filled with clear light and fire and large repose <br>
         Like a fair hound's; no man there is but knows <br>
         Her face was white, and thereto she was tall; <br>
         In no wise lacked there any praise at all <br>
         To her most perfect and pure maidenhood; <br>
         No sin I think there was in all her blood.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She, where a gold grate shut the roses in, <br>
         Dwelt daily through deep summer weeks, through green <br>
         Hushed hours of rain upon the leaves; and there <br>
         Love made him room and space to worship her <br>
         With tender worship of bowed knees, and wrought <br>
         Such pleasure as the pained sense palates not <br>
         For weariness, but at one taste undoes <br>
         The heart of its strong sweet, is ravenous <br>
         Of all the hidden honey; words and sense <br>
         Fail through the tune's imperious prevalence.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In a poor house this lover kept apart, <br>
         Long communing with patience next his heart <br>
         
         <center>295<br></center>
         If love of his might move that face at all, <br>
         Tuned evenwise with colours musical; <br>
         Then after length of days he said thus: "Love, <br>
         For love's own sake and for the love thereof <br>
         Let no harsh words untune your gracious mood; <br>
         For good it were, if anything be good, <br>
         To comfort me in this pain's plague of mine; <br>
         Seeing thus, how neither sleep nor bread nor wine <br>
         Seems pleasant to me, yea no thing that is <br>
         Seems pleasant to me; only I know this; <br>
         Love's ways are sharp for palms of piteous feet <br>
         To travel, but the end of such is sweet:<br>
         Now do with me as seemeth you the best." <br>
         She mused a little, as one holds his guest <br>
         By the hand musing, with her face borne down: <br>
         Then said: "Yea, though such bitter seed be sown, <br>
         Have no more care of all that you have said; <br>
         Since if there is no sleep will bind your head, <br>
         Lo, I am fain to help you certainly; <br>
         Christ knoweth, sir, if I would have you die; <br>
         There is no pleasure when a man is dead." <br>
         Thereat he kissed her hands and yellow head <br>
         And clipped her fair long body many times; <br>
         I have no wit to shape in written rhymes <br>
         A scanted tithe of this great joy they had.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         They were too near love's secret to be glad; <br>
         As whoso deems the core will surely melt <br>
         From the warm fruit his lips caress, hath felt <br>
         
         <center>296<br></center>
         Some bitter kernel where the teeth shut hard: <br>
         Or as sweet music sharpens afterward, <br>
         Being half disrelished both for sharp and sweet; <br>
         As sea-water, having killed over-heat <br>
         In a man's body, chills it with faint ache; <br>
         So their sense, burdened only for love's sake, <br>
         Failed for pure love; yet so time served their wit, <br>
         They saved each day some gold reserves of it, <br>
         Being wiser in love's riddle than such be <br>
         Whom fragments feed with his chance charity. <br>
         All things felt sweet were felt sweet overmuch; <br>
         The rose-thorn's prickle dangerous to touch, <br>
         And flecks of fire in the thin leaf-shadows; <br>
         Too keen the breathÃ¨d honey of the rose, <br>
         Its red too harsh a weight on feasted eyes; <br>
         They were so far gone in love's histories, <br>
         Beyond all shape and colour and mere breath, <br>
         Where pleasure has for kinsfolk sleep and death,<br>
         And strength of soul and body waxen blind <br>
         For weariness, and flesh entoiled with mind, <br>
         When the keen edge of sense foretasteth sin.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Even this green place the summer caught them in <br>
         Seemed half deflowered and sick with beaten leaves <br>
         In their strayed eyes; these gold flower-fumÃ¨d eves <br>
         Burnt out to make the sun's love-offering, <br>
         The midnoon's prayer, the rose's thanksgiving, <br>
         The trees' weight burdening the strengthless air, <br>
         The shape of her stilled eyes, her coloured hair, <br>
         
         <center>297<br></center>
         Her body's balance from the moving feetâ <br>
         All this, found fair, lacked yet one grain of sweet <br>
         It had some warm weeks back: so perisheth <br>
         On May's new lip the tender April breath: <br>
         So those same walks the wind sowed lilies in <br>
         All April through, and all their latter kin <br>
         Of languid leaves whereon the autumn blowsâ <br>
         The dead red raiment of the last year's roseâ <br>
         The last year's laurel, and the last year's love, <br>
         Fade, and grow things that death grows weary of.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What man will gather in red summer-time <br>
         The fruit of some obscure and hoary rhyme <br>
         Heard last midwinter, taste the heart in it, <br>
         Mould the smooth semitones afresh, refit <br>
         The fair limbs ruined, flush the dead blood through <br>
         With colour, make all broken beauties new <br>
         For love's new lessonâshall not such find pain <br>
         When the marred music labouring in his brain <br>
         Frets him with sweet sharp fragments, and lets slip <br>
         One word that might leave satisfied his lipâ <br>
         One touch that might put fire in all the chords? <br>
         This was her pain: to miss from all sweet words <br>
         Some taste of sound, diverse and delicateâ <br>
         Some speech the old love found out to compensate<br>
         For seasons of shut lips and drowsinessâ <br>
         Some grace, some word the old love found out to bless <br>
         Passionless months and undelighted weeks. <br>
         The flowers had lost their summer-scented cheeks, <br>
         
         <center>298<br></center>
         Their lips were no more sweet than daily breath: <br>
         The year was plagued with instances of death.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         So fell it, these were sitting in cool grass <br>
         With leaves about, and many a bird there was <br>
         Where the green shadow thickliest impleached <br>
         Soft fruit and writhen spray and blossom bleached <br>
         Dry in the sun or washed with rains to white: <br>
         Her girdle was pure silk, the bosom bright <br>
         With purple as purple water and gold wrought in. <br>
         One branch had touched with dusk her lips and chin, <br>
         Made violet of the throat, abashed with shade <br>
         The breast's bright plaited work: but nothing frayed <br>
         The sun's large kiss on the luxurious hair. <br>
         Her beauty was new colour to the air <br>
         And music to the silent many birds. <br>
         Love was an-hungred for some perfect words <br>
         To praise her with; but only her low name <br>
         "Andrevuola" came thrice, and thrice put shame <br>
         In her clear cheek, so fruitful with new red <br>
         That for pure love straightway shame's self was dead.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then with lids gathered as who late had wept <br>
         She began saying: "I have so little slept <br>
         My lids drowse now against the very sun; <br>
         Yea, the brain aching with a dream begun <br>
         Beats like a fitful blood; kiss but both brows, <br>
         And you shall pluck my thoughts grown dangerous <br>
         Almost away." He said thus, kissing them: <br>
         "O sole sweet thing that God is glad to name, <br>
         
         <center>299<br></center>
         My one gold gift, if dreams be sharp and sore <br>
         Shall not the waking time increase much more<br>
         With taste and sound, sweet eyesight or sweet scent? <br>
         Has any heat too hard and insolent <br>
         Burnt bare the tender married leaves, undone <br>
         The maiden grass shut under from the sun? <br>
         Where in this world is room enough for pain?"<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The feverish finger of love had touched again <br>
         Her lips with happier blood; the pain lay meek <br>
         In her fair face, nor altered lip nor cheek <br>
         With pallor or with pulse; but in her mouth <br>
         Love thirsted as a man wayfaring doth, <br>
         Making it humble as weak hunger is. <br>
         She lay close to him, bade do this and this, <br>
         Say that, sing thus: then almost weeping-ripe <br>
         Crouched, then laughed low. As one that fain would wipe <br>
         The old record out of old things done and dead, <br>
         She rose, she heaved her hands up, and waxed red <br>
         For wilful heart and blameless fear of blame; <br>
         Saying "Though my wits be weak, this is no shame <br>
         For a poor maid whom love so punisheth <br>
         With heats of hesitation and stopped breath <br>
         That with my dreams I live yet heavily <br>
         For pure sad heart and faith's humility. <br>
         Now be not wroth and I will show you this.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         "Methought our lips upon their second kiss <br>
         Met in this place, and a fair day we had <br>
         And fair soft leaves that waxed and were not sad <br>
         
         <center>300<br></center>
         With shaken rain or bitten through with drouth; <br>
         When I, beholding ever how your mouth <br>
         Waited for mine, the throat being fallen back, <br>
         Saw crawl thereout a live thing flaked with black <br>
         Specks of brute slime and leper-coloured scale, <br>
         A devil's hide with foul flame-writhen grail<br>
         Fashioned where hell's heat festers loathsomest; <br>
         And that brief speech may ease me of the rest, <br>
         Thus were you slain and eaten of the thing. <br>
         My waked eyes felt the new day shuddering <br>
         On their low lids, felt the whole east so beat, <br>
         Pant with close pulse of such a plague-struck heat, <br>
         As if the palpitating dawn drew breath <br>
         For horror, breathing between life and death, <br>
         Till the sun sprang blood-bright and violent."<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         So finishing, her soft strength wholly spent, <br>
         She gazed each way, lest some brute-hoovÃ¨d thing, <br>
         The timeless travail of hell's childbearing, <br>
         Should threat upon the sudden: whereat he, <br>
         For relish of her tasted misery <br>
         And tender little thornprick of her pain, <br>
         Laughed with mere love. What lover among men <br>
         But hath his sense fed sovereignly 'twixt whiles <br>
         With tears and covered eyelids and sick smiles <br>
         And soft disaster of a painÃ¨d face? <br>
         What pain, established in so sweet a place, <br>
         But the plucked leaf of it smells fragrantly? <br>
         What colour burning man's wide-open eye <br>
         
         <center>301<br></center>
         But may be pleasurably seen? what sense <br>
         Keeps in its hot sharp extreme violence <br>
         No savour of sweet things? The bereaved blood <br>
         And emptied flesh in their most broken mood <br>
         Fail not so wholly, famish not when thus <br>
         Past honey keeps the starved lip covetous.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Therefore this speech from a glad mouth began, <br>
         Breathed in her tender hair and temples wan <br>
         Like one prolonged kiss while the lips had breath: <br>
         "Sleep, that abides in vassalage of death <br>
         And in death's service wears out half his age, <br>
         Hath his dreams full of deadly vassalage,<br>
         Shadow and sound of things ungracious; <br>
         Fair shallow faces, hooded bloodless brows, <br>
         And mouths past kissing; yea, myself have had <br>
         As harsh a dream as holds your eyelids sad.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         "This dream I tell you came three nights ago: <br>
         In full mid sleep I took a whim to know <br>
         How sweet things might be; so I turned and thought; <br>
         But save my dream all sweet availed me not. <br>
         First came a smell of pounded spice and scent <br>
         Such as God ripens in some continent <br>
         Of utmost amber in the Syrian sea; <br>
         And breaths as though some costly rose could be <br>
         Spoiled slowly, wasted by some bitter fire <br>
         To burn the sweet out leaf by leaf, and tire <br>
         The flower's poor heart with heat and waste, to make <br>
         Strong magic for some perfumed woman's sake. <br>
         
         <center>302<br></center>
         Then a cool naked sense beneath my feet <br>
         Of bud and blossom; and sound of veins that beat <br>
         As if a lute should play of its own heart <br>
         And fearfully, not smitten of either part; <br>
         And all my blood it filled with sharp and sweet <br>
         As gold swoln grain fills out the huskÃ¨d wheat; <br>
         So I rose naked from the bed, and stood <br>
         Counting the mobile measure in my blood <br>
         Some pleasant while, and through each limb there came <br>
         Swift little pleasures pungent as a flame, <br>
         Felt in the thrilling flesh and veins as much <br>
         As the outer curls that feel the comb's first touch <br>
         Thrill to the roots and shiver as from fire; <br>
         And blind between my dream and my desire <br>
         I seemed to stand and held my spirit still <br>
         Lest this should cease. A child whose fingers spill<br>
         Honey from cells forgotten of the bee <br>
         Is less afraid to stir the hive and see <br>
         Some wasp's bright back inside, than I to feel <br>
         Some finger-touch disturb the flesh like steel. <br>
         I prayed thus; Let me catch a secret here <br>
         So sweet, it sharpens the sweet taste of fear <br>
         And takes the mouth with edge of wine; I would <br>
         Have here some colour and smooth shape as good <br>
         As those in heaven whom the chief garden hides <br>
         With low grape-blossom veiling their white sides <br>
         And lesser tendrils that so bind and blind <br>
         Their eyes and feet, that if one come behind <br>
         
         <center>303<br></center>
         To touch their hair they see not, neither fly; <br>
         This would I see in heaven and not die. <br>
         So praying, I had nigh cried out and knelt, <br>
         So wholly my prayer filled me: till I felt <br>
         In the dumb night's warm weight of glowing gloom <br>
         Somewhat that altered all my sleeping-room, <br>
         And made it like a green low place wherein <br>
         Maids mix to bathe: one sets her small warm chin <br>
         Against a ripple, that the angry pearl <br>
         May flow like flame about her: the next curl <br>
         Dips in some eddy coloured of the sun <br>
         To wash the dust well out; another one <br>
         Holds a straight ankle in her hand and swings <br>
         With lavish body sidelong, so that rings <br>
         Of sweet fierce water, swollen and splendid, fail <br>
         All round her fine and floated body pale, <br>
         Swayed flower-fashion, and her balanced side <br>
         Swerved edgeways lets the weight of water slide, <br>
         As taken in some underflow of sea <br>
         Swerves the banked gold of sea-flowers; but she <br>
         Pulls down some branch to keep her perfect head <br>
         Clear of the river: even from wall to bed,<br>
         I tell you, was my room transfigured so. <br>
         Sweet, green and warm it was, nor could one know <br>
         If there were walls or leaves, or if there was <br>
         No bed's green curtain, but mere gentle grass. <br>
         There were set also hard against the feet <br>
         Gold plates with honey and green grapes to eat, <br>
         
         <center>304<br></center>
         With the cool water's noise to hear in rhymes: <br>
         And a wind warmed me full of furze and limes <br>
         And all hot sweets the heavy summer fills <br>
         To the round brim of smooth cup-shapen hills. <br>
         Next the grave walking of a woman's feet <br>
         Made my veins hesitate, and gracious heat <br>
         Made thick the lids and leaden on mine eyes: <br>
         And I thought ever, surely it were wise <br>
         Not yet to see her: this may last (who knows?) <br>
         Five minutes; the poor rose is twice a rose <br>
         Because it turns a face to her, the wind <br>
         Sings that way; hath this woman ever sinned, <br>
         I wonder? as a boy with apple-rind, <br>
         I played with pleasures, made them to my mind, <br>
         Changed each ere tasting. When she came indeed, <br>
         First her hair touched me, then I grew to feed <br>
         On the sense of her hand; her mouth at last <br>
         Touched me between the cheek and lip and past <br>
         Over my face with kisses here and there <br>
         Sown in and out across the eyes and hair. <br>
         Still I said nothing; till she set her face <br>
         More close and harder on the kissing-place, <br>
         And her mouth caught like a snake's mouth, and stung <br>
         So faint and tenderly, the fang scarce clung <br>
         More than a bird's foot: yet a wound it grew, <br>
         A great one, let this red mark witness you<br>
         Under the left breast; and the stroke thereof <br>
         So clove my sense that I woke out of love <br>
         
         <center>305<br></center>
         And knew not what this dream was nor had wit; <br>
         But now God knows if I have skill of it."<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Hereat she laid one palm against her lips <br>
         To stop their trembling; as when water slips <br>
         Out of a beak-mouthed vessel with faint noise <br>
         And chuckles in the narrowed throat and cloys <br>
         The carven rims with murmuring, so came <br>
         Words in her lips with no word right of them, <br>
         A beaten speech thick and disconsolate, <br>
         Till his smile ceasing waxed compassionate <br>
         Of her sore fear that grew from anythingâ <br>
         The sound of the strong summer thickening <br>
         In heated leaves of the smooth apple-trees: <br>
         The day's breath felt about the ash-branches, <br>
         And noises of the noon whose weight still grew <br>
         On the hot heavy-headed flowers, and drew <br>
         Their red mouths open till the rose-heart ached; <br>
         For eastward all the crowding rose was slaked <br>
         And soothed with shade; but westward all its growth <br>
         Seemed to breathe hard with heat as a man doth <br>
         Who feels his temples newly feverous. <br>
         And even with such motion in her brows <br>
         As that man hath in whom sick days begin, <br>
         She turned her throat and spake, her voice being thin <br>
         As a sick man's, sudden and tremulous; <br>
         "Sweet, if this end be come indeed on us, <br>
         Let us love more;" and held his mouth with hers. <br>
         As the first sound of flooded hill-waters <br>
         
         <center>306<br></center>
         Is heard by people of the meadow-grass, <br>
         Or ever a wandering waif of ruin pass <br>
         With whirling stones and foam of the brown stream <br>
         Flaked with fierce yellow: so beholding him<br>
         She felt before tears came her eyelids wet, <br>
         Saw the face deadly thin where life was yet, <br>
         Heard his throat's harsh last moan before it clomb: <br>
         And he, with close mouth passionate and dumb, <br>
         Burned at her lips: so lay they without speech, <br>
         Each grasping other, and the eyes of each <br>
         Fed in the other's face: till suddenly <br>
         He cried out with a little broken cry <br>
         This word, "O help me, sweet, I am but dead." <br>
         And even so saying, the colour of fair red <br>
         Was gone out of his face, and his blood's beat <br>
         Fell, and stark death made sharp his upward feet <br>
         And pointed hands: and without moan he died. <br>
         Pain smote her sudden in the brows and side, <br>
         Strained her lips open and made burn her eyes: <br>
         For the pure sharpness of her miseries <br>
         She had no heart's pain, but mere body's wrack; <br>
         But at the last her beaten blood drew back <br>
         Slowly upon her face, and her stunned brows <br>
         Suddenly grown aware and piteous <br>
         Gathered themselves, her eyes shone, her hard breath <br>
         Came as though one nigh dead came back from death; <br>
         
         <center>307<br></center>
         Her lips throbbed, and life trembled through her hair.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And in brief while she thought to bury there <br>
         The dead man that her love might lie with him <br>
         In a sweet bed under the rose-roots dim <br>
         And soft earth round the branchÃ¨d apple-trees, <br>
         Full of hushed heat and heavy with great ease, <br>
         And no man entering divide him thence. <br>
         Wherefore she bade one of her handmaidens <br>
         To be her help to do upon this wise. <br>
         And saying so the tears out of her eyes <br>
         Fell without noise and comforted her heart: <br>
         Yea, her great pain eased of the sorest part<br>
         Began to soften in her sense of it. <br>
         There under all the little branches sweet <br>
         The place was shapen of his burial; <br>
         They shed thereon no thing funereal, <br>
         But coloured leaves of latter rose-blossom, <br>
         Stems of soft grass, some withered red and some <br>
         Fair and fresh-blooded; and spoil splendider <br>
         Of marigold and great spent sunflower.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And afterward she came back without word <br>
         To her own house; two days went, and the third <br>
         Went, and she showed her father of this thing. <br>
         And for great grief of her soul's travailing <br>
         He gave consent she should endure in peace <br>
         Till her life's end; yea, till her time should cease, <br>
         She should abide in fellowship of pain. <br>
         And having lived a holy year or twain <br>
         
         <center>308<br></center>
         She died of pure waste heart and weariness. <br>
         And for love's honour in her love's distress <br>
         This word was written over her tomb's head; <br>
         "Here dead she lieth, for whose sake Love is dead."<br>

         <h3>AHOLIBAH.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">In </span>the beginning God made thee <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         A woman well to look upon, <br>
         Thy tender body as a tree <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whereon cool wind hath always blown <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Till the clean branches be well grown.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There was none like thee in the land; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The girls that were thy bondwomen <br>
         Did bind thee with a purple band <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Upon thy forehead, that all men <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Should know thee for God's handmaiden.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Strange raiment clad thee like a bride, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With silk to wear on hands and feet <br>
         And plates of gold on either side: <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Wine made thee glad, and thou didst eat <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Honey, and choice of pleasant meat.<br>
         
         
         <center>310<br></center>
         <br><br>
         And fishers in the middle sea <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Did get thee sea-fish and sea-weeds <br>
         In colour like the robes on thee; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And curious work of plaited reeds, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And wools wherein live purple bleeds.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And round the edges of thy cup <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Men wrought thee marvels out of gold, <br>
         Strong snakes with lean throats lifted up, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Large eyes whereon the brows had hold, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And scaly things their slime kept cold.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For thee they blew soft wind in flutes <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And ground sweet roots for cunning scent; <br>
         Made slow because of many lutes, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The wind among thy chambers went <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Wherein no light was violent.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         God called thy name Aholibah, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         His tabernacle being in thee, <br>
         A witness through waste Asia; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thou wert a tent sewn cunningly <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With gold and colours of the sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         God gave thee gracious ministers <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And all their work who plait and weave: <br>
         The cunning of embroiderers <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That sew the pillow to the sleeve, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And likeness of all things that live.<br>
         
         
         <center>311<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Thy garments upon thee were fair <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With scarlet and with yellow thread; <br>
         Also the weaving of thine hair <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Was as fine gold upon thy head, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And thy silk shoes were sewn with red.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All sweet things he bade sift, and ground <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As a man grindeth wheat in mills <br>
         With strong wheels alway going round; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         He gave thee corn, and grass that fills <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The cattle on a thousand hills.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The wine of many seasons fed <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thy mouth, and made it fair and clean; <br>
         Sweet oil was poured out on thy head <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And ran down like cool rain between <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The strait close locks it melted in.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The strong men and the captains knew <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thy chambers wrought and fashioned <br>
         With gold and covering of blue, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the blue raiment of thine head <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Who satest on a stately bed.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All these had on their garments wrought <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The shape of beasts and creeping things, <br>
         The body that availeth not, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Flat backs of worms and veinÃ¨d wings, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the lewd bulk that sleeps and stings.<br>
         
         
         <center>312<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Also the chosen of the years, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The multitude being at ease, <br>
         With sackbuts and with dulcimers <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And noise of shawms and psalteries <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Made mirth within the ears of these.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But as a common woman doth, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thou didst think evil and devise; <br>
         The sweet smell of thy breast and mouth <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thou madest as the harlot's wise, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And there was painting on thine eyes.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, in the woven guest-chamber <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And by the painted passages <br>
         Where the strange gracious paintings were, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         State upon state of companies, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         There came on thee the lust of these.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Because of shapes on either wall <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Sea-coloured from some rare blue shell <br>
         At many a Tyrian interval, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Horsemen on horses, girdled well, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Delicate and desirable,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Thou saidest: I am sick of love: <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Stay me with flagons, comfort me <br>
         With apples for my pain thereof <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Till my hands gather in his tree <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That fruit wherein my lips would be.<br>
         
         
         <center>313<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Yea, saidest thou, I will go up <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         When there is no more shade than one <br>
         May cover with a hollow cup, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And make my bed against the sun <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Till my blood's violence be done.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Thy mouth was leant upon the wall <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Against the painted mouth, thy chin <br>
         Touched the hair's painted curve and fall; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thy deep throat, fallen lax and thin, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Worked as the blood's beat worked therein.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Therefore, O thou Aholibah, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         God is not glad because of thee; <br>
         And thy fine gold shall pass away <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Like those fair coins of ore that be <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Washed over by the middle sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then will one make thy body bare <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To strip it of all gracious things, <br>
         And pluck the cover from thine hair, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And break the gift of many kings, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thy wrist-rings and thine ankle-rings.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Likewise the man whose body joins <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To thy smooth body, as was said, <br>
         Who hath a girdle on his loins <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And dyed attire upon his headâ <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The same who, seeing, worshipped,<br>
         
         
         <center>314<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Because thy face was like the face <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Of a clean maiden that smells sweet, <br>
         Because thy gait was as the pace <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Of one that opens not her feet <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And is not heard within the streetâ <br>
         
         <br><br>
         Even he, O thou Aholibah, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Made separate from thy desire, <br>
         Shall cut thy nose and ears away <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And bruise thee for thy body's hire <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And burn the residue with fire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then shall the heathen people say, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The multitude being at ease; <br>
         Lo, this is that Aholibah <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whose name was blown among strange seas, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Grown old with soft adulteries.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Also her bed was made of green, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Her windows beautiful for glass <br>
         That she had made her bed between: <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Yea, for pure lust her body was <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Made like white summer-coloured grass.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Her raiment was a strong man's spoil; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Upon a table by a bed <br>
         She set mine incense and mine oil <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To be the beauty of her head <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         In chambers walled about with red.<br>
         
         
         <center>315<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Also between the walls she had <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Fair faces of strong men portrayed; <br>
         All girded round the loins, and clad <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With several cloths of woven braid <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And garments marvellously made.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Therefore the wrath of God shall be <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Set as a watch upon her way; <br>
         And whoso findeth by the sea <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Blown dust of bones will hardly say <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         If this were that Aholibah. <br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Lying</span> asleep between the strokes of night <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I saw my love lean over my sad bed, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Pale as the duskiest lily's leaf or head, <br>
         Smooth-skinned and dark, with bare throat made to bite, <br>
         Too wan for blushing and too warm for white, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But perfect-coloured without white or red. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And her lips opened amorously, and saidâ <br>
         I wist not what, saving one wordâDelight. <br>
         And all her face was honey to my mouth, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And all her body pasture to mine eyes; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire, <br>
         The quivering flanks, hair smelling of the south, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The bright light feet, the splendid supple thighs <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And glittering eyelids of my soul's desire. <br>

         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Under</span> green apple-boughs <br>
         That never a storm will rouse, <br>
         My lady hath her house <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Between two bowers; <br>
         In either of the twain <br>
         Red roses full of rain; <br>
         She hath for bondwomen <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All kind of flowers.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She hath no handmaid fair <br>
         To draw her curled gold hair <br>
         Through rings of gold that bear <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her whole hair's weight; <br>
         She hath no maids to stand <br>
         Gold-clothed on either hand; <br>
         In all the great green land <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         None is so great.<br>
         
         
         <center>318<br></center>
         <br><br>
         She hath no more to wear <br>
         But one white hood of vair <br>
         Drawn over eyes and hair, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wrought with strange gold, <br>
         Made for some great queen's head, <br>
         Some fair great queen since dead; <br>
         And one strait gown of red <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Against the cold.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Beneath her eyelids deep <br>
         Love lying seems asleep, <br>
         Love, swift to wake, to weep, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To laugh, to gaze; <br>
         Her breasts are like white birds, <br>
         And all her gracious words <br>
         As water-grass to herds <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the June-days.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         To her all dews that fall <br>
         And rains are musical; <br>
         Her flowers are fed from all, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her joy from these; <br>
         In the deep-feathered firs <br>
         Their gift of joy is hers, <br>
         In the least breath that stirs <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Across the trees.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She grows with greenest leaves, <br>
         Ripens with reddest sheaves, <br>
         
         <center>319<br></center>
         Forgets, remembers, grieves, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And is not sad; <br>
         The quiet lands and skies <br>
         Leave light upon her eyes; <br>
         None knows her, weak or wise, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or tired or glad.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         None knows, none understands, <br>
         What flowers are like her hands; <br>
         Though you should search all lands <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wherein time grows, <br>
         What snows are like her feet, <br>
         Though his eyes burn with heat <br>
         Through gazing on my sweet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yet no man knows.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Only this thing is said; <br>
         That white and gold and red, <br>
         God's three chief words, man's bread <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And oil and wine, <br>
         Were given her for dowers, <br>
         And kingdom of all hours, <br>
         And grace of goodly flowers <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And various vine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         This is my lady's praise: <br>
         God after many days <br>
         Wrought her in unknown ways, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In sunset lands; <br>
         
         <center>320<br></center>
         This was my lady's birth; <br>
         God gave her might and mirth <br>
         And laid his whole sweet earth <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Between her hands.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Under deep apple-boughs <br>
         My lady hath her house; <br>
         She wears upon her brows <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The flower thereof; <br>
         All saying but what God saith <br>
         To her is as vain breath; <br>
         She is more strong than death, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Being strong as love. <br>

         We were ten maidens by a well-head, <br>

         White bread and brown for the king's daughter.<br>

         The seventh to woo, the eighth to wed, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fair thin reeds in the mill-water; <br>
         The ninth had gold work on her head, <br>

         Honey in the comb for the king's daughter.<br>

         Golden gloves for the king's daughter.<br>

         Golden sleeves for the king's daughter.<br>

         Red rose leaves will never make wine?" <br>
         "Six times to kiss his young mouth on, <br>

         <h3>THE YEAR OF LOVE.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">There </span>were four loves that one by one, <br>
         Following the seasons and the sun, <br>
         Passed over without tears, and fell <br>
         Away without farewell.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The first was made of gold and tears, <br>
         The next of aspen-leaves and fears, <br>
         The third of rose-boughs and rose-roots, <br>
         The last love of strange fruits.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         These were the four loves faded. Hold <br>
         Some minutes fast the time of gold <br>
         When our lips each way clung and clove <br>
         To a face full of love.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The tears inside our eyelids met, <br>
         Wrung forth with kissing, and wept wet <br>
         The faces cleaving each to each <br>
         Where the blood served for speech.<br>
         
         
         <center>338<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The second, with low patient brows <br>
         Bound under aspen-coloured boughs <br>
         And eyes made strong and grave with sleep <br>
         And yet too weak to weepâ <br>
         
         <br><br>
         The third, with eager mouth at ease <br>
         Fed from late autumn honey, lees <br>
         Of scarce gold left in latter cells <br>
         With scattered flower-smellsâ <br>
         
         <br><br>
         Hair sprinkled over with spoilt sweet <br>
         Of ruined roses, wrists and feet <br>
         Slight-swathed, as grassy-girdled sheaves <br>
         Hold in stray poppy-leavesâ <br>
         
         <br><br>
         The fourth, with lips whereon has bled <br>
         Some great pale fruit's slow colour, shed <br>
         From the rank bitten husk whence drips <br>
         Faint blood between her lipsâ <br>
         
         <br><br>
         Made of the heat of whole great Junes <br>
         Burning the blue dark round their moons <br>
         (Each like a mown red marigold) <br>
         So hard the flame keeps holdâ <br>
         
         <br><br>
         These are burnt thoroughly away. <br>
         Only the first holds out a day <br>
         Beyond these latter loves that were <br>
         Made of mere heat and air.<br>
         
         
         <center>339<br></center>
         <br><br>
         And now the time is winterly <br>
         The first love fades too: none will see, <br>
         When April warms the world anew, <br>
         The place wherein love grew. <br>

         <h3>DEDICATION.</h3>
         
         <h3>1865.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">The </span>sea gives her shells to the shingle, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The earth gives her streams to the sea; <br>
         They are many, but my gift is single, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         My verses, the firstfruits of me. <br>
         Let the wind take the green and the grey leaf, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Cast forth without fruit upon air; <br>
         Take rose-leaf and vine-leaf and bay-leaf <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Blown loose from the hair.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The night shakes them round me in legions, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Dawn drives them before her like dreams; <br>
         Time sheds them like snows on strange regions, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Swept shoreward on infinite streams; <br>
         Leaves pallid and sombre and ruddy, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Dead fruits of the fugitive years; <br>
         Some stained as with wine and made bloody, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And some as with tears.<br>
         
         <center>341<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Some scattered in seven years' traces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As they fell from the boy that was then; <br>
         Long left among idle green places, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or gathered but now among men;<br>
         On seas full of wonder and peril, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Blown white round the capes of the north; <br>
         Or in islands where myrtles are sterile <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And loves bring not forth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O daughters of dreams and of stories <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That life is not wearied of yet, <br>
         Faustine, Fragoletta, Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         FÃ©lise and Yolande and Juliette, <br>
         Shall I find you not still, shall I miss you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When sleep, that is true or that seems, <br>
         Comes back to me hopeless to kiss you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O daughters of dreams?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They are past as a slumber that passes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As the dew of a dawn of old time; <br>
         More frail than the shadows on glasses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         More fleet than a wave or a rhyme. <br>
         As the waves after ebb drawing seaward, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When their hollows are full of the night, <br>
         So the birds that flew singing to me-ward <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Recede out of sight.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The songs of dead seasons, that wander <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         On wings of articulate words; <br>
         
         <center>342<br></center>
         Lost leaves that the shore-wind may squander, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Light flocks of untameable birds; <br>
         Some sang to me dreaming in class-time <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And truant in hand as in tongue; <br>
         For the youngest were born of boy's pastime, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The eldest are young.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Is there shelter while life in them lingers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is there hearing for songs that recede,<br>
         Tunes touched from a harp with man's fingers <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or blown with boy's mouth in a reed? <br>
         Is there place in the land of your labour, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is there room in your world of delight, <br>
         Where change has not sorrow for neighbour <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And day has not night?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In their wings though the sea-wind yet quivers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Will you spare not a space for them there <br>
         Made green with the running of rivers <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And gracious with temperate air; <br>
         In the fields and the turreted cities, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That cover from sunshine and rain <br>
         Fair passions and bountiful pities <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And loves without stain?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In a land of clear colours and stories, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In a region of shadowless hours, <br>
         Where earth has a garment of glories <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And a murmur of musical flowers; <br>
         
         <center>343<br></center>
         In woods where the spring half uncovers <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The flush of her amorous face, <br>
         By the waters that listen for lovers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For these is there place?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For the song-birds of sorrow, that muffle <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Their music as clouds do their fire: <br>
         For the storm-birds of passion, that ruffle <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wild wings in a wind of desire; <br>
         In the stream of the storm as it settles <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Blown seaward, borne far from the sun, <br>
         Shaken loose on the darkness like petals <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Dropt one after one?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Though the world of your hands be more gracious <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And lovelier in lordship of things <br>
         Clothed round by sweet art with the spacious <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Warm heaven of her imminent wings, <br>
         Let them enter, unfledged and nigh fainting, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For the love of old loves and lost times; <br>
         And receive in your palace of painting <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This revel of rhymes.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Though the seasons of man full of losses <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Make empty the years full of youth, <br>
         If but one thing be constant in crosses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Change lays not her hand upon truth; <br>
         Hopes die, and their tombs are for token <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That the grief as the joy of them ends <br>
         
         <center>344<br></center>
         Ere time that breaks all men has broken <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The faith between friends.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Though the many lights dwindle to one light, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There is help if the heaven has one; <br>
         Though the skies be discrowned of the sunlight <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the earth dispossessed of the sun, <br>
         They have moonlight and sleep for repayment, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When, refreshed as a bride and set free, <br>
         With stars and sea-winds in her raiment, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Night sinks on the sea. <br>
