         <h3>A BALLAD OF LIFE</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">I found</span> in dreams a place
         of wind and flowers,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Full of sweet trees and colour
         of glad grass,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         In midst whereof there was
         <br>
         
         A lady clothed like summer with sweet hours.
         
         <br>
         
         Her beauty, fervent as a fiery moon,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Made my blood burn and
         swoon
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Like a flame rained upon.
         
         <br>
         
         Sorrow had filled her shaken eyelids'
         blue,
         <br>
         
         And her mouth's sad red heavy
         rose all through
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Seemed sad with glad things gone.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         She held a little cithern by the
         strings,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Shaped heartwise, strung with
         subtle-coloured hair
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Of some dead lute-player
         <br>
         
         That in dead years had done delicious
         things.
         
         <br>
         
         <center>2<br></center>
         
         The seven strings were named
         accordingly;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         The first string charity,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         The second tenderness,
         <br>
         
         The rest were pleasure, sorrow,
         sleep, and sin,
         <br>
         
         And loving-kindness, that is
         pity's kin
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         And is most pitiless.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         There were three men with her, each
         garmented
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         With gold and shod with gold
         upon the feet;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And with plucked ears of
         wheat
         <br>
         
         The first man's hair was wound
         upon his head.
         <br>
         
         His face was red, and his mouth
         curled and sad;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         All his gold raiment had
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Pale stains of dust and rust.
         
         <br>
         
         A riven hood was pulled across his eyes;
         <br>
         
         The token of him being upon
         this wise
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Made for a sign of Lust.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         The next was Shame, with hollow heavy
         face
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Coloured like green wood when flame kindles
         it.
         
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         He hath such feeble feet
         <br>
         
         They may not well endure in any place.
         
         <br>
         
         His face was full of grey old miseries,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And all his blood's
         increase
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Was even increase of pain.
         <br>
         
         The last was Fear, that is akin to
         Death;
         <br>
         
         He is Shame's friend, and
         always as Shame saith
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Fear answers him again.
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>3<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         My soul said in me; This is marvellous,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Seeing the air's face is not so
         delicate
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Nor the sun's grace so
         great,
         <br>
         
         If sin and she be kin or amorous.
         
         <br>
         
         And seeing where maidens served her on their
         knees,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         I bade one crave of these
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         To know the cause thereof.
         
         <br>
         
         Then Fear said: I am Pity that was dead.
         <br>
         
         And Shame said: I am Sorrow comforted.
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         And Lust said: I am Love.
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Thereat her hands began a lute-playing,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And her sweet mouth a song in a
         strange tongue;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And all the while she sung
         <br>
         
         There was no sound but long
         tears following
         <br>
         
         Long tears upon men's faces
         waxen white
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         With extreme sad delight.
         
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         But those three following men
         <br>
         
         Became as men raised up among
         the dead;
         <br>
         
         Great glad mouths open and fair
         cheeks made red
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         With child's blood come again.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Then I said: Now assuredly I see
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         My lady is perfect, and
         transfigureth
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         All sin and sorrow and
         death,
         <br>
         
         Making them fair as her own
         eyelids be,
         <br>
         
         Or lips wherein my whole soul's
         life abides;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Or as her sweet white sides
         <br>
         
         <center>4<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         And bosom carved to kiss.
         
         <br>
         
         Now therefore, if her pity further me,
         <br>
         
         Doubtless for her sake all my
         days shall be
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         As righteous as she is.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Forth, ballad, and take roses in both
         arms,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Even till the top rose touch
         thee in the throat
         <br>
         
         Where the least thornprick
         harms;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And girdled in thy golden
         singing-coat,
         <br>
         
         Come thou before my lady and
         say this;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Borgia, thy gold hair's colour
         burns in me,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Thy mouth makes beat my blood
         in feverish rhymes;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Therefore so many as these
         roses be,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Kiss me so many times.
         
         <br>
         
         Then it may be, seeing how sweet she is,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         That she will stoop herself
         none otherwise
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Than a blown vine-branch
         doth,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And kiss thee with soft
         laughter on thine eyes,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         
         Ballad, and on thy mouth.

         <h3>A BALLAD OF DEATH</h3>

         Girdle thyself with sighing for
         a girth
         <br>
         
         Upon the sides of mirth,
         <br>
         
         Cover thy lips and eyelids, let
         thine ears
         <br>
         
         Be filled with rumour of people
         sorrowing;
         <br>
         
         Make thee soft raiment out of
         woven sighs
         <br>
         
         Upon the flesh to cleave,
         <br>
         
         Set pains therein and many a
         grievous thing,
         <br>
         
         And many sorrows after each his
         wise
         <br>
         
         For armlet and for gorget and for sleeve.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         O Love's lute heard about the lands of
         death,
         <br>
         
         Left hanged upon the trees that
         were therein;
         <br>
         
         O Love and Time and Sin,
         <br>
         
         Three singing mouths that mourn
         now underbreath,
         <br>
         
         Three lovers, each one evil
         spoken of;
         <br>
         
         O smitten lips wherethrough
         this voice of mine
         <br>
         
         Came softer with her
         praise;
         <br>
         
         Abide a little for our lady's love.
         
         <br>
         
         The kisses of her mouth were more than
         wine,
         <br>
         
         And more than peace the passage of her days.
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>6<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         O Love, thou knowest if she were good to see.
         <br>
         
         O Time, thou shalt not find in any land
         <br>
         
         Till, cast out of thine
         hand,
         <br>
         
         The sunlight and the moonlight
         fail from thee,
         <br>
         
         Another woman fashioned like as this.
         
         <br>
         
         O Sin, thou knowest that all thy shame in
         her
         <br>
         
         Was made a goodly thing;
         <br>
         
         Yea, she caught Shame and
         shamed him with her kiss,
         <br>
         
         With her fair kiss, and lips
         much lovelier
         <br>
         
         Than lips of amorous roses in late spring.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         By night there stood over against my bed
         <br>
         
         Queen Venus with a hood striped
         gold and black,
         <br>
         
         Both sides drawn fully back
         <br>
         
         From brows wherein the sad
         blood failed of red,
         <br>
         
         And temples drained of purple and full of
         death.
         
         <br>
         
         Her curled hair had the wave of
         sea-water
         <br>
         
         And the sea's gold in it.
         
         <br>
         
         Her eyes were as a dove's that sickeneth.
         <br>
         
         Strewn dust of gold she had shed over
         her,
         <br>
         
         And pearl and purple and amber on her feet.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Upon her raiment of dyed sendaline
         <br>
         
         Were painted all the secret
         ways of love
         <br>
         
         And covered things thereof,
         <br>
         
         That hold delight as
         grape-flowers hold their wine;
         <br>
         
         Red mouths of maidens and red
         feet of doves,
         <br>
         
         And brides that kept within the
         bride-chamber
         <br>
         
         <center>7<br></center>
         
         Their garment of soft
         shame,
         <br>
         
         And weeping faces of the
         wearied loves
         <br>
         
         That swoon in sleep and awake
         wearier,
         <br>
         
         With heat of lips and hair shed out like
         flame.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         The tears that through her eyelids fell on
         me
         <br>
         
         Made mine own bitter where they
         ran between
         <br>
         
         As blood had fallen
         therein,
         <br>
         
         She saying; Arise, lift up
         thine eyes and see
         <br>
         
         If any glad thing be or any
         good
         <br>
         
         Now the best thing is taken
         forth of us;
         <br>
         
         Even she to whom all praise
         <br>
         
         Was as one flower in a great
         multitude,
         <br>
         
         One glorious flower of many and
         glorious,
         <br>
         
         One day found gracious among
         many days:
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Even she whose handmaiden was
         Love—to whom
         <br>
         
         At kissing times across her
         stateliest bed
         <br>
         
         Kings bowed themselves and
         shed
         <br>
         
         Pale wine, and honey with the
         honeycomb,
         <br>
         
         And spikenard bruised for a
         burnt-offering;
         <br>
         
         Even she between whose lips the
         kiss became
         <br>
         
         As fire and frankincense;
         <br>
         
         Whose hair was as gold raiment
         on a king,
         <br>
         
         Whose eyes were as the morning
         purged with flame,
         <br>
         
         Whose eyelids as sweet savour issuing
         thence.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Then I beheld, and lo on the other side
         <br>
         
         My lady's likeness crowned and robed and
         dead.
         
         <br>
         
         <center>8<br></center>
         
         Sweet still, but now not red,
         <br>               
         
         Was the shut mouth whereby men lived and
         died.
         
         <br>
         
         And sweet, but emptied of the blood's blue
         shade,
         <br>
         
         The great curled eyelids that withheld her
         eyes.
         
         <br>
         
         And sweet, but like spoilt gold,
         <br>
         
         The weight of colour in her tresses weighed.
         
         <br>
         
         And sweet, but as a vesture with new
         dyes,
         <br>
         
         The body that was clothed with love of old.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Ah! that my tears filled all her woven
         hair
         <br>
         
         And all the hollow bosom of her
         gown—
         <br>
         
         Ah! that my tears ran down
         <br>
         
         Even to the place where many
         kisses were,
         <br>
         
         Even where her parted
         breast-flowers have place,
         <br>
         
         Even where they are cloven apart—who knows
         not this?
         
         <br>
         
         Ah! the flowers cleave apart
         <br>
         
         And their sweet fills the
         tender interspace;
         <br>
         
         Ah! the leaves grown thereof
         were things to kiss
         <br>
         
         Ere their fine gold was tarnished at the
         heart.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Ah! in the days when God did good to me,
         <br>
         
         Each part about her was a
         righteous thing;
         <br>
         
         Her mouth an almsgiving,
         <br>
         
         The glory of her garments
         charity,
         <br>
         
         The beauty of her bosom a good
         deed,
         <br>
         
         In the good days when God kept
         sight of us;
         <br>
         
         Love lay upon her eyes,
         <br>
         
         And on that hair whereof the
         world takes heed;
         <br>
         
         <center>9<br></center>                
         
         And all her body was more
         virtuous
         <br>                
         
         Than souls of women fashioned otherwise.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Now, ballad, gather poppies in thine
         hands
         <br>
         
          And sheaves of brier and many
         rusted sheaves
         <br>
         
         Rain-rotten in rank lands,
         <br>
         
         Waste marigold and late unhappy
         leaves
         <br>
         
         And grass that fades ere any of
         it be mown;
         <br>
         
         And when thy bosom is filled
         full thereof
         <br>
         
         Seek out Death's face ere the
         light altereth,
         <br>
         
         And say "My master that was
         thrall to Love
         <br>
         
         Is become thrall to Death."
         
         <br>
         
         Bow down before him, ballad, sigh and
         groan,
         <br>
         
         But make no sojourn in thy
         outgoing;
         <br>
         
         For haply it may be
         <br>
         
         That when thy feet return at
         evening
         <br>
         
         Death shall come in with thee.

         Lors dit en plourant; Hélas trop
         malheureux homme et mauldict pescheur, oncques ne verrai-je
         clémence et miséricorde de Dieu.
         Ores m'en irai-je d'icy et me
         cacherai dedans le mont Horsel, en requérant de faveur et
         d'amoureuse merci ma doulce dame Vénus, car pour son amour
         serai-je bien à tout jamais damné en enfer.
         Voicy la fin de tous mes faicts
         d'armes et de toutes mes belles chansons.
         Hélas, trop belle estoyt la face
         de ma dame et ses yeulx, et en mauvais jour je vis ces
         chouses-là.
         Lors s'en alla tout en gémissant
         et se retourna chez elle, et là vescut tristement en grand amour
         près de sa dame.
         Puis après advint que le pape
         vit un jour esclater sur son baston force belles fleurs rouges
         et blanches et maints boutons de feuilles, et ainsi vit-il
         reverdir toute l'escorce.
         Ce dont il eut grande crainte et
         moult s'en esmut, et grande pitié lui prit de ce chevalier qui
         s'en estoyt départi sans espoir comme un homme misérable et
         damné.
         Doncques envoya force messaigers
         devers luy pour le ramener, disant qu'il aurait de Dieu grace et
         bonne absolution de son grand péché d'amour.
         Mais oncques plus ne le virent;
         car toujours demeura ce pauvre chevalier auprès de Vénus la
         haulte et forte déesse ès flancs de la montagne amoureuse.

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Asleep</span> or waking is it? for her neck,
         <br>
         
         Kissed over close, wears yet a purple speck
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Wherein the pained blood falters and goes out;
         <br>
         
         Soft, and stung
         softly—fairer for a fleck.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         But though my lips
         shut sucking on the place,

         There is no vein at work upon her face;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Her eyelids are so peaceable, no doubt
         <br>
         
         Deep sleep has
         warmed her blood through all its ways.

         <br><br>
         
         Lo, this is she
         that was the world's delight;
         <br>
         
         The old grey years were parcels of her might;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         The strewings of the ways wherein she trod
         <br>
         
         Were the twain
         seasons of the day and night.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Lo, she was thus
         when her clear limbs enticed
         <br>
         
         All lips that now grow sad with kissing
         Christ,

         &nbsp;
         
         Stained with blood fallen from the feet of
         God,
         <br>
         
         The feet and hands
         whereat our souls were priced.
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>14<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         Alas, Lord, surely thou art great and
         fair.
         <br>
         
         
         But lo her wonderfully woven hair!
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And thou didst
         heal us with thy piteous kiss;
         <br>
         
         But see now, Lord;
         her mouth is lovelier.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         She is right fair; what hath she done to
         thee?
         <br>
         
         Nay, fair Lord
         Christ, lift up thine eyes and see;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Had now thy mother
         such a lip—like this?
         
         <br>
         
         Thou knowest how sweet a thing it is to
         me.
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Inside the Horsel
         here the air is hot;
         <br>
         
         Right little peace one hath for it, God wot;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         The scented dusty daylight burns the air,
         <br>
         
         And my heart
         chokes me till I hear it not.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Behold, my Venus,
         my soul's body, lies
         <br>
         
         With my love laid upon her garment-wise,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Feeling my love in all her limbs and hair
         <br>
         
         And shed between
         her eyelids through her eyes.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         She holds my heart
         in her sweet open hands
         <br>
         
         Hanging asleep; hard by her head there stands,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Crowned with gilt thorns and clothed with flesh
         like fire,
         <br>
         
         Love, wan as foam blown up the salt burnt sands—
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Hot as the brackish waifs of yellow spume
         <br>
         
         That shift and steam—loose clots of arid
         fume
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         From the sea's panting mouth of dry desire;
         <br>
         
         There stands he,
         like one labouring at a loom.
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>15<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         The warp holds
         fast across; and every thread
         <br>
         
         That makes the woof up has dry specks of red;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Always the shuttle cleaves clean through, and
         he
         <br>
         
         Weaves with the
         hair of many a ruined head.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Love is not glad
         nor sorry, as I deem;
         <br>
         
         Labouring he dreams, and labours in the dream,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Till when the spool is finished, lo I see
         <br>
         
         His web, reeled
         off, curls and goes out like steam.
         
         <br>
                 
         <br><br>
         
         Night falls like
         fire; the heavy lights run low,
         <br>
         
         And as they drop, my blood and body so
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Shake as the flame shakes, full of days and
         hours
         <br>
         
         That sleep not
         neither weep they as they go.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Ah yet would God
         this flesh of mine might be
         <br>
         
         Where air might wash and long leaves cover me,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Where tides of grass break into foam of
         flowers,
         <br>
         
         Or where the
         wind's feet shine along the sea.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Ah yet would God
         that stems and roots were bred
         <br>
         
         Out of my weary body and my head,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         That sleep were sealed upon me with a seal,
         <br>
         
         And I were as the
         least of all his dead.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Would God my blood
         were dew to feed the grass,
         <br>
         
         Mine ears made deaf and mine eyes blind as
         glass,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         My body broken as a turning wheel,
         <br>
         
         And my mouth
         stricken ere it saith Alas!
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>16<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         Ah God, that love
         were as a flower or flame,
         <br>
         
         That life were as the naming of a name,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         That death were not more pitiful than desire,
         <br>
         
         That these things
         were not one thing and the same!
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Behold now, surely
         somewhere there is death:
         <br>
         
         For each man hath some space of years, he
         saith,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         A little space of time ere time expire,
         <br>
         
         A little day, a
         little way of breath.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         And lo, between
         the sundawn and the sun,
         <br>
         
         His day's work and his night's work are
         undone;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And lo, between the nightfall and the night,
         <br>
         
         He is not, and
         none knoweth of such an one.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Ah God, that I
         were as all souls that be,
         <br>
         
         As any herb or leaf of any tree,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         As men that toil through hours of labouring
         light,
         <br>
         
         As bones of men
         under the deep sharp sea.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Outside it must be
         winter among men;
         <br>
         
         For at the gold bars of the gates again
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         I heard all night and all the hours of it
         <br>
         
         The wind's wet
         wings and fingers drip with rain.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Knights gather,
         riding sharp for cold; I know
         <br>
         
         The ways and woods are strangled with the
         snow;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         And with short song the maidens spin and sit
         <br>
         
         Until Christ's
         birthnight, lily-like, arow.
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>17<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         The scent and
         shadow shed about me make
         <br>
         
         The very soul in all my senses ache;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         The hot hard night is fed upon my breath,
         <br>
         
         And sleep beholds me from afar awake.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Alas, but surely
         where the hills grow deep,
         <br>
         
         Or where the wild ways of the sea are steep,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Or in strange places somewhere there is death,
         <br>
         
         And on death's
         face the scattered hair of sleep.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         There lover-like
         with lips and limbs that meet
         <br>
         
         They lie, they pluck sweet fruit of life and eat;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         But me the hot and hungry days devour,
         <br>
         
         And in my mouth no
         fruit of theirs is sweet.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         No fruit of
         theirs, but fruit of my desire,
         <br>
         
         For her love's sake whose lips through mine respire;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Her eyelids on her eyes like flower on flower,
         <br>
         
         Mine eyelids on
         mine eyes like fire on fire.
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>15<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         So lie we, not as
         sleep that lies by death,
         <br>
         
         With heavy kisses and with happy breath;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Not as man lies by woman, when the bride
         <br>
         
         Laughs low for
         love's sake and the word's he saith.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         For she lies,
         laughing low with love; she lies,
         <br>
         
         And turns his kisses on her lips to sighs,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         To sighing sound of lips unsatisfied,
         <br>
         
         And the sweet
         tears are tender with her eyes.
         
         <br>
         
         
         <center>18<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         Ah, not as they,
         but as the souls that were
         <br>
         
         Slain in the old time, having found her fair;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Who, sleeping with her lips upon their eyes,
         <br>
         
         Heard sudden
         serpents hiss across her hair.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Their blood runs
         round the roots of time like rain;
         <br>
         
         She casts them forth and gathers them again;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         With nerve and bone she weaves and multiplies
         <br>
         
         Exceeding pleasure
         out of extreme pain.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Her little
         chambers drip with flower-like red,
         <br>
         
         Her girdles, and the chaplets of her head,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Her armlets and her anklets; with her feet
         <br>
         
         She tramples all
         that winepress of the dead.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Her gateways smoke
         with fume of flowers and fires,
         <br>
         
         With loves burnt out and unassuaged desires;
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Between her lips the steam of them is sweet,
         <br>
         
         The languor in her ears of many lyres.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         Her beds are full
         of perfume and sad sound,
         <br>
         
         Her doors are made with music, and barred round
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         With sighing and with laughter and with tears,
         <br>
         
         With tears whereby
         strong souls of men are bound.
         
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         There is the knight Adonis that was slain; <br>
         With flesh and blood she chains him for a chain; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The body and the spirit in her ears <br>
         Cry, for her lips divide him vein by vein.<br>
         
         
         <center>19<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Yea, all she slayeth; yea, every man save me; <br>
         Me, love, thy lover that must cleave to thee <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till the ending of the days and ways of earth, <br>
         The shaking of the sources of the sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Me, most forsaken of all souls that fell; <br>
         Me, satiated with things insatiable; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Me, for whose sake the extreme hell makes mirth, <br>
         Yea, laughter kindles at the heart of hell.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Alas thy beauty! for thy mouth's sweet sake <br>
         My soul is bitter to me, my limbs quake <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As water, as the flesh of men that weep, <br>
         As their heart's vein whose heart goes nigh to break.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah God, that sleep with flower-sweet finger-tips <br>
         Would crush the fruit of death upon my lips; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ah God, that death would tread the grapes of sleep <br>
         And wring their juice upon me as it drips.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There is no change of cheer for many days, <br>
         But change of chimes high up in the air, that sways <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Rung by the running fingers of the wind; <br>
         And singing sorrows heard on hidden ways.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Day smiteth day in twain, night sundereth night, <br>
         And on mine eyes the dark sits as the light; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yea, Lord, thou knowest I know not, having sinned, <br>
         If heaven be clean or unclean in thy sight.<br>
         
         
         <center>20<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Yea, as if earth were sprinkled over me, <br>
         Such chafed harsh earth as chokes a sandy sea, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Each pore doth yearn, and the dried blood thereof <br>
         Gasps by sick fits, my heart swims heavily,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There is a feverish famine in my veins; <br>
         Below her bosom, where a crushed grape stains <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The white and blue, there my lips caught and clove <br>
         An hour since, and what mark of me remains?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I dare not always touch her, lest the kiss <br>
         Leave my lips charred. Yea, Lord, a little bliss, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Brief bitter bliss, one hath for a great sin; <br>
         Nathless thou knowest how sweet a thing it is.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Sin, is it sin whereby men's souls are thrust <br>
         Into the pit? yet had I a good trust <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To save my soul before it slipped therein, <br>
         Trod under by the fire-shod feet of lust.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For if mine eyes fail and my soul takes breath, <br>
         I look between the iron sides of death <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Into sad hell where all sweet love hath end, <br>
         All but the pain that never finisheth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There are the naked faces of great kings, <br>
         The singing folk with all their lute-playings; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There when one cometh he shall have to friend <br>
         The grave that covets and the worm that clings.<br>
         
         
         <center>21<br></center>
         <br><br>
         There sit the knights that were so great of hand, <br>
         The ladies that were queens of fair green land, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Grown grey and black now, brought unto the dust, <br>
         Soiled, without raiment, clad about with sand.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There is one end for all of them; they sit <br>
         Naked and sad, they drink the dregs of it, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Trodden as grapes in the wine-press of lust, <br>
         Trampled and trodden by the fiery feet.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I see the marvellous mouth whereby there fell <br>
         Cities and people whom the gods loved well, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yet for her sake on them the fire gat hold, <br>
         And for their sakes on her the fire of hell.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And softer than the Egyptian lote-leaf is, <br>
         The queen whose face was worth the world to kiss, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wearing at breast a suckling snake of gold; <br>
         And large pale lips of strong Semiramis,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Curled like a tiger's that curl back to feed; <br>
         Red only where the last kiss made them bleed; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her hair most thick with many a carven gem, <br>
         Deep in the mane, great-chested, like a steed.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, with red sin the faces of them shine; <br>
         But in all these there was no sin like mine; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No, not in all the strange great sins of them <br>
         That made the wine-press froth and foam with wine.<br>
         
         
         <center>22<br></center>
         <br><br>
         For I was of Christ's choosing, I God's knight, <br>
         No blinkard heathen stumbling for scant light; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I can well see, for all the dusty days <br>
         Gone past, the clean great time of goodly fight.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I smell the breathing battle sharp with blows, <br>
         With shriek of shafts and snapping short of bows; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The fair pure sword smites out in subtle ways, <br>
         Sounds and long lights are shed between the rows<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Of beautiful mailed men; the edged light slips, <br>
         Most like a snake that takes short breath and dips <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sharp from the beautifully bending head, <br>
         With all its gracious body lithe as lips<br>
         
         <br><br>
         That curl in touching you; right in this wise <br>
         My sword doth, seeming fire in mine own eyes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Leaving all colours in them brown and red <br>
         And flecked with death; then the keen breaths like sighs,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The caught-up choked dry laughters following them, <br>
         When all the fighting face is grown a flame <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For pleasure, and the pulse that stuns the ears, <br>
         And the heart's gladness of the goodly game.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let me think yet a little; I do know <br>
         These things were sweet, but sweet such years ago, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Their savour is all turned now into tears; <br>
         Yea, ten years since, where the blue ripples blow,<br>
         
         
         <center>23<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The blue curled eddies of the blowing Rhine, <br>
         I felt the sharp wind shaking grass and vine <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Touch my blood too, and sting me with delight <br>
         Through all this waste and weary body of mine<br>
         
         <br><br>
         That never feels clear air; right gladly then <br>
         I rode alone, a great way off my men, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And heard the chiming bridle smite and smite, <br>
         And gave each rhyme thereof some rhyme again,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Till my song shifted to that iron one; <br>
         Seeing there rode up between me and the sun <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Some certain of my foe's men, for his three <br>
         White wolves across their painted coats did run.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The first red-bearded, with square cheeks—alack, <br>
         I made my knave's blood turn his beard to black; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The slaying of him was a joy to see: <br>
         Perchance too, when at night he came not back,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Some woman fell a-weeping, whom this thief <br>
         Would beat when he had drunken; yet small grief <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Hath any for the ridding of such knaves; <br>
         Yea, if one wept, I doubt her teen was brief.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         This bitter love is sorrow in all lands, <br>
         Draining of eyelids, wringing of drenched hands, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sighing of hearts and filling up of graves; <br>
         A sign across the head of the world he stands,<br>
         
         
         <center>24<br></center>
         <br><br>
         An one that hath a plague-mark on his brows; <br>
         Dust and spilt blood do track him to his house <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Down under earth; sweet smells of lip and cheek, <br>
         Like a sweet snake's breath made more poisonous<br>
         
         <br><br>
         With chewing of some perfumed deadly grass, <br>
         Are shed all round his passage if he pass, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And their quenched savour leaves the whole soul
         weak, <br>
         Sick with keen guessing whence the perfume was.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         As one who hidden in deep sedge and reeds <br>
         Smells the rare scent made where a panther feeds, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And tracking ever slotwise the warm smell <br>
         Is snapped upon by the sweet mouth and bleeds,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         His head far down the hot sweet throat of her—<br>
         So one tracks love, whose breath is deadlier, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And lo, one springe and you are fast in hell, <br>
         Fast as the gin's grip of a wayfarer.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I think now, as the heavy hours decease <br>
         One after one, and bitter thoughts increase <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One upon one, of all sweet finished things; <br>
         The breaking of the battle; the long peace<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Wherein we sat clothed softly, each man's hair <br>
         Crowned with green leaves beneath white hoods of vair; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The sound of sharp spears at great tourneyings, <br>
         And noise of singing in the late sweet air.<br>
         
         
         <center>25<br></center>
         <br><br>
         I sang of love too, knowing nought thereof; <br>
         "Sweeter," I said, "the little laugh of love <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than tears out of the eyes of Magdalen, <br>
         Or any fallen feather of the Dove.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "The broken little laugh that spoils a kiss, <br>
         The ache of purple pulses, and the bliss <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of blinded eyelids that expand again—<br>
         Love draws them open with those lips of his,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "Lips that cling hard till the kissed face has grown <br>
         Of one same fire and colour with their own; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then ere one sleep, appeased with sacrifice, <br>
         Where his lips wounded, there his lips atone."<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I sang these things long since and knew them not; <br>
         "Lo, here is love, or there is love, God wot, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This man and that finds favour in his eyes," <br>
         I said, "but I, what guerdon have I got?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "The dust of praise that is blown everywhere <br>
         In all men's faces with the common air; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The bay-leaf that wants chafing to be sweet <br>
         Before they wind it in a singer's hair."<br>
         
         <br><br>
         So that one dawn I rode forth sorrowing; <br>
         I had no hope but of some evil thing, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And so rode slowly past the windy wheat, <br>
         And past the vineyard and the water-spring,<br>
         
         
         <center>26<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Up to the Horsel. A great elder-tree <br>
         Held back its heaps of flowers to let me see <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The ripe tall grass, and one that walked therein, <br>
         Naked, with hair shed over to the knee.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She walked between the blossom and the grass; <br>
         I knew the beauty of her, what she was, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The beauty of her body and her sin, <br>
         And in my flesh the sin of hers, alas!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Alas! for sorrow is all the end of this. <br>
         O sad kissed mouth, how sorrowful it is! <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O breast whereat some suckling sorrow clings, <br>
         Red with the bitter blossom of a kiss!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah, with blind lips I felt for you, and found <br>
         About my neck your hands and hair enwound, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The hands that stifle and the hair that stings, <br>
         I felt them fasten sharply without sound.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, for my sin I had great store of bliss: <br>
         Rise up, make answer for me, let thy kiss <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Seal my lips hard from speaking of my sin, <br>
         Lest one go mad to hear how sweet it is.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yet I waxed faint with fume of barren bowers, <br>
         And murmuring of the heavy-headed hours; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And let the dove's beak fret and peck within <br>
         My lips in vain, and Love shed fruitless flowers.<br>
         
         
         <center>27<br></center>
         <br><br>
         So that God looked upon me when your hands <br>
         Were hot about me; yea, God brake my bands <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To save my soul alive, and I came forth <br>
         Like a man blind and naked in strange lands<br>
         
         <br><br>
         That hears men laugh and weep, and knows not whence <br>
         Nor wherefore, but is broken in his sense; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Howbeit I met folk riding from the north <br>
         Toward Rome, to purge them of their souls' offence,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And rode with them, and spake to none; the day <br>
         Stunned me like lights upon some wizard way, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And ate like fire mine eyes and mine eyesight; <br>
         So rode I, hearing all these chant and pray,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And marvelled; till before us rose and fell <br>
         White cursed hills, like outer skirts of hell <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Seen where men's eyes look through the day to night, <br>
         Like a jagged shell's lips, harsh, untunable,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Blown in between by devils' wrangling breath; <br>
         Nathless we won well past that hell and death, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Down to the sweet land where all airs are good, <br>
         Even unto Rome where God's grace tarrieth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then came each man and worshipped at his knees <br>
         Who in the Lord God's likeness bears the keys <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To bind or loose, and called on Christ's shed blood, <br>
         And so the sweet-souled father gave him ease.<br>
         
         
         <center>28<br></center>
         <br><br>
         But when I came I fell down at his feet, <br>
         Saying, "Father, though the Lord's blood be right sweet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The spot it takes not off the panther's skin, <br>
         Nor shall an Ethiop's stain be bleached with it.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "Lo, I have sinned and have spat out at God, <br>
         Wherefore his hand is heavier and his rod <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         More sharp because of mine exceeding sin, <br>
         And all his raiment redder than bright blood<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "Before mine eyes; yea, for my sake I wot <br>
         The heat of hell is waxen seven times hot <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Through my great sin." Then spake he some sweet
         word, <br>
         Giving me cheer; which thing availed me not;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, scarce I wist if such indeed were said; <br>
         For when I ceased—lo, as one newly dead <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who hears a great cry out of hell, I heard <br>
         The crying of his voice across my head.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "Until this dry shred staff, that hath no whit <br>
         Of leaf nor bark, bear blossom and smell sweet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Seek thou not any mercy in God's sight, <br>
         For so long shalt thou be cast out from it."<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, what if dried-up stems wax red and green, <br>
         Shall that thing be which is not nor has been? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yea, what if sapless bark wax green and white, <br>
         Shall any good fruit grow upon my sin?<br>
         
         
         <center>29<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Nay, though sweet fruit were plucked of a dry tree, <br>
         And though men drew sweet waters of the sea, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There should not grow sweet leaves on this dead
         stem, <br>
         This waste wan body and shaken soul of me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, though God search it warily enough, <br>
         There is not one sound thing in all thereof; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though he search all my veins through, searching
         them <br>
         He shall find nothing whole therein but love.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For I came home right heavy, with small cheer, <br>
         And lo my love, mine own soul's heart, more dear <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than mine own soul, more beautiful than God, <br>
         Who hath my being between the hands of her— <br>
         
         <br><br>
         Fair still, but fair for no man saving me, <br>
         As when she came out of the naked sea <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Making the foam as fire whereon she trod, <br>
         And as the inner flower of fire was she.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, she laid hold upon me, and her mouth <br>
         Clove unto mine as soul to body doth, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And, laughing, made her lips luxurious; <br>
         Her hair had smells of all the sunburnt south,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Strange spice and flower, strange savour of crushed fruit, <br>
         And perfume the swart kings tread underfoot <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For pleasure when their minds wax amorous, <br>
         Charred frankincense and grated sandal-root.<br>
         
         
         <center>30<br></center>
         <br><br>
         And I forgot fear and all weary things, <br>
         All ended prayers and perished thanksgivings, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Feeling her face with all her eager hair <br>
         Cleave to me, clinging as a fire that clings<br>
         
         <br><br>
         To the body and to the raiment, burning them; <br>
         As after death I know that such-like flame <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall cleave to me for ever; yea, what care, <br>
         Albeit I burn then, having felt the same?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah love, there is no better life than this; <br>
         To have known love, how bitter a thing it is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And afterward be cast out of God's sight; <br>
         Yea, these that know not, shall they have such bliss<br>
         
         <br><br>
         High up in barren heaven before his face <br>
         As we twain in the heavy-hearted place, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Remembering love and all the dead delight, <br>
         And all that time was sweet with for a space?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For till the thunder in the trumpet be, <br>
         Soul may divide from body, but not we <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One from another; I hold thee with my hand, <br>
         I let mine eyes have all their will of thee,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I seal myself upon thee with my might, <br>
         Abiding alway out of all men's sight <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Until God loosen over sea and land <br>
         The thunder of the trumpets of the night.<br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Lay</span> not thine hand upon me; let me go; <br>
         Take off thine eyes that put the gods to shame; <br>

         <br><br>
         Nay, I will never loosen hold nor breathe <br>
         Till thou have slain me; godlike for great brows <br>
         Thou art, and thewed as gods are, with clear hair: <br>
         Draw now thy sword and smite me as thou art god, <br>
         For verily I am smitten of other gods, <br>
         Why not of thee?<br>

         O queen, take heed of words; <br>
         Why wilt thou eat the husk of evil speech? <br>
         Wear wisdom for that veil about thy head <br>

         Nay, but this god hath cause enow to smite: <br>
         If he will slay me, baring breast and throat, <br>
         I lean toward the stroke with silent mouth <br>
         And a great heart. Come, take thy sword and slay;<br>
         Let me not starve between desire and death, <br>
         But send me on my way with glad wet lips; <br>
         For in the vein-drawn ashen-coloured palm <br>
         Death's hollow hand holds water of sweet draught <br>
         To dip and slake dried mouths at, as a deer <br>
         Specked red from thorns laps deep and loses pain. <br>
         Yea, if mine own blood ran upon my mouth, <br>
         I would drink that. Nay, but be swift with me; <br>
         Set thy sword here between the girdle and breast, <br>
         For I shall grow a poison if I live. <br>
         Are not my cheeks as grass, my body pale, <br>
         And my breath like a dying poisoned man's? <br>
         O whatsoever of godlike names thou be, <br>
         By thy chief name I charge thee, thou strong god, <br>
         And bid thee slay me. Strike, up to the gold, <br>
         Up to the hand-grip of the hilt; strike here; <br>
         For I am Cretan of my birth; strike now; <br>
         For I am Theseus' wife; stab up to the rims, <br>
         I am born daughter to Pasiphae. <br>
         See thou spare not for greatness of my blood, <br>
         Nor for the shining letters of my name: <br>
         Make thy sword sure inside thine hand and smite, <br>

         <br><br>
         Man, what have I to do with shame or thee? <br>
         I am not of one counsel with the gods. <br>
         I am their kin, I have strange blood in me, <br>
         I am not of their likeness nor of thine: <br>
         My veins are mixed, and therefore am I mad, <br>
         Yea therefore chafe and turn on mine own flesh, <br>
         Half of a woman made with half a god. <br>
         But thou wast hewn out of an iron womb <br>
         And fed with molten mother-snow for milk. <br>
         A sword was nurse of thine; Hippolyta, <br>
         That had the spear to father, and the axe <br>
         To bridesman, and wet blood of sword-slain men <br>
         
         <center>34<br></center>
         For wedding-water out of a noble well, <br>
         Even she did bear thee, thinking of a sword, <br>
         And thou wast made a man mistakingly. <br>
         Nay, for I love thee, I will have thy hands, <br>
         Nay, for I will not loose thee, thou art sweet, <br>
         Thou art my son, I am thy father's wife, <br>
         I ache toward thee with a bridal blood, <br>
         The pulse is heavy in all my married veins, <br>
         My whole face beats, I will feed full of thee, <br>
         My body is empty of ease, I will be fed, <br>
         I am burnt to the bone with love, thou shalt not go, <br>
         I am heartsick, and mine eyelids prick mine eyes, <br>
         Thou shalt not sleep nor eat nor say a word <br>
         Till thou hast slain me. I am not good to live.<br>
         
         
         
         CHORUS.
         <br><br>
         This is an evil born with all its teeth, <br>

         I hate not it nor anything of thine. <br>
         Lo, maidens, how he burns about the brow, <br>
         And draws the chafing sword-strap down his hand. <br>
         What wilt thou do? wilt thou be worse than death? <br>
         Be but as sweet as is the bitterest, <br>
         
         <center>35<br></center>
         The most dispiteous out of all the gods, <br>
         I am well pleased. Lo, do I crave so much? <br>
         I do but bid thee be unmerciful, <br>
         Even the one thing thou art. Pity me not: <br>
         Thou wert not quick to pity. Think of me <br>
         As of a thing thy hounds are keen upon <br>
         In the wet woods between the windy ways, <br>
         And slay me for a spoil. This body of mine <br>
         Is worth a wild beast's fell or hide of hair, <br>
         And spotted deeper than a panther's grain. <br>
         I were but dead if thou wert pure indeed; <br>
         I pray thee by thy cold green holy crown <br>
         And by the fillet-leaves of Artemis. <br>
         Nay, but thou wilt not. Death is not like thee, <br>
         Albeit men hold him worst of all the gods. <br>
         For of all gods Death only loves not gifts,*
         <br>
         Nor with burnt-offering nor blood-sacrifice <br>
         Shalt thou do aught to get thee grace of him; <br>
         He will have naught of altar and altar-song, <br>
         And from him only of all the lords in heaven <br>
         Persuasion turns a sweet averted mouth.<br>
         But thou art worse: from thee with baffled breath <br>
         Back on my lips my prayer falls like a blow, <br>
         And beats upon them, dumb. What shall I say? <br>
         There is no word I can compel thee with <br>
         
         <center>36<br></center>
         To do me good and slay me. But take heed; <br>
         I say, be wary; look between thy feet, <br>
         Lest a snare take them though the ground be good.<br>

         Shame may do most where fear is found most weak: <br>
         That which for shame's sake yet I have not done, <br>
         Shall it be done for fear's? Take thine own way; <br>
         Better the foot slip than the whole soul swerve.<br>

         O women, O sweet people of this land, <br>
         O goodly city and pleasant ways thereof, <br>
         And woods with pasturing grass and great well-heads, <br>
         And hills with light and night between your leaves, <br>
         And winds with sound and silence in your lips, <br>
         And earth and water and all immortal things, <br>
         I take you to my witness what I am. <br>
         There is a god about me like as fire, <br>
         Sprung whence, who knoweth, or who hath heart to say? <br>
         A god more strong than whom slain beasts can soothe, <br>
         Or honey, or any spilth of blood-like wine, <br>
         Nor shall one please him with a whitened brow <br>
         Nor wheat nor wool nor aught of plaited leaf. <br>
         For like my mother am I stung and slain, <br>
         And round my cheeks have such red malady <br>
         And on my lips such fire and foam as hers. <br>
         This is that Ate out of Amathus <br>
         That breeds up death and gives it one for love. <br>
         She hath slain mercy, and for dead mercy's sake <br>
         (Being frighted with this sister that was slain) <br>
         Flees from before her fearful-footed shame, <br>
         And will not bear the bending of her brows <br>
         And long soft arrows flown from under them <br>
         As from bows bent. Desire flows out of her <br>
         As out of lips doth speech: and over her <br>
         Shines fire, and round her and beneath her fire. <br>
         She hath sown pain and plague in all our house, <br>
         
         <center>38<br></center>
         Love loathed of love, and mates unmatchable, <br>
         Wild wedlock, and the lusts that bleat or low,<br>
         And marriage-fodder snuffed about of kine. <br>
         Lo how the heifer runs with leaping flank <br>
         Sleek under shaggy and speckled lies of hair, <br>
         And chews a horrible lip, and with harsh tongue <br>
         Laps alien froth and licks a loathlier mouth. <br>
         Alas, a foul first steam of trodden tares, <br>
         And fouler of these late grapes underfoot. <br>
         A bitter way of waves and clean-cut foam <br>
         Over the sad road of sonorous sea <br>
         The high gods gave king Theseus for no love, <br>
         Nay, but for love, yet to no loving end. <br>
         Alas the long thwarts and the fervent oars, <br>
         And blown hard sails that straightened the scant rope! <br>
         There were no strong pools in the hollow sea <br>
         To drag at them and suck down side and beak, <br>
         No wind to catch them in the teeth and hair, <br>
         No shoal, no shallow among the roaring reefs, <br>
         No gulf whereout the straining tides throw spars, <br>
         No surf where white bones twist like whirled white fire. <br>
         But like to death he came with death, and sought <br>
         And slew and spoiled and gat him that he would. <br>
         For death, for marriage, and for child-getting, <br>
         I set my curse against him as a sword; <br>
         Yea, and the severed half thereof I leave <br>
         Pittheus, because he slew not (when that face <br>
         Was tender, and the life still soft in it) <br>
         
         <center>39<br></center>
         The small swathed child, but bred him for my fate. <br>
         I would I had been the first that took her death <br>
         Out from between wet hoofs and reddened teeth, <br>
         Splashed horns, fierce fetlocks of the brother-bull! <br>
         For now shall I take death a deadlier way, <br>
         Gathering it up between the feet of love <br>
         Or off the knees of murder reaching it.<br>
         
         
         
         
         
         <br><br>
         
         * Æsch. Fr. Niobe:—
         <br><br>
         μόνoς θεῶν γὰρ Θάνατος οὐ δώρων
         ἐρᾷ, κ.τ.λ.--&gt;<br>

         <h3>THE TRIUMPH OF TIME</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Before</span> our lives divide for ever, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         While time is with us and hands are free, <br>
         (Time, swift to fasten and swift to sever <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Hand from hand, as we stand by the sea) <br>
         I will say no word that a man might say <br>
         Whose whole life's love goes down in a day; <br>
         For this could never have been; and never, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though the gods and the years relent, shall be.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Is it worth a tear, is it worth an hour, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To think of things that are well outworn? <br>
         Of fruitless husk and fugitive flower, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The dream foregone and the deed forborne? <br>
         Though joy be done with and grief be vain, <br>
         Time shall not sever us wholly in twain; <br>
         Earth is not spoilt for a single shower; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But the rain has ruined the ungrown corn.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         It will grow not again, this fruit of my heart, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Smitten with sunbeams, ruined with rain. <br>
         The singing seasons divide and depart, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Winter and summer depart in twain. <br>
         
         <center>41<br></center>
         It will grow not again, it is ruined at root, <br>
         The bloodlike blossom, the dull red fruit; <br>
         Though the heart yet sickens, the lips yet smart, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With sullen savour of poisonous pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I have given no man of my fruit to eat; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I trod the grapes, I have drunken the wine. <br>
         Had you eaten and drunken and found it sweet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This wild new growth of the corn and vine, <br>
         This wine and bread without lees or leaven, <br>
         We had grown as gods, as the gods in heaven, <br>
         Souls fair to look upon, goodly to greet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One splendid spirit, your soul and mine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In the change of years, in the coil of things, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the clamour and rumour of life to be, <br>
         We, drinking love at the furthest springs, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Covered with love as a covering tree, <br>
         We had grown as gods, as the gods above, <br>
         Filled from the heart to the lips with love, <br>
         Held fast in his hands, clothed warm with his wings, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O love, my love, had you loved but me!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We had stood as the sure stars stand, and moved <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As the moon moves, loving the world; and seen <br>
         Grief collapse as a thing disproved, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Death consume as a thing unclean. <br>
         Twain halves of a perfect heart, made fast <br>
         Soul to soul while the years fell past; <br>
         
         <center>42<br></center>
         Had you loved me once, as you have not loved; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Had the chance been with us that has not been.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I have put my days and dreams out of mind, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Days that are over, dreams that are done. <br>
         Though we seek life through, we shall surely find <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There is none of them clear to us now, not one. <br>
         But clear are these things; the grass and the sand, <br>
         Where, sure as the eyes reach, ever at hand, <br>
         With lips wide open and face burnt blind, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The strong sea-daisies feast on the sun.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The low downs lean to the sea; the stream, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One loose thin pulseless tremulous vein, <br>
         Rapid and vivid and dumb as a dream, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Works downward, sick of the sun and the rain; <br>
         No wind is rough with the rank rare flowers; <br>
         The sweet sea, mother of loves and hours, <br>
         Shudders and shines as the grey winds gleam, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Turning her smile to a fugitive pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Mother of loves that are swift to fade, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Mother of mutable winds and hours. <br>
         A barren mother, a mother-maid, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Cold and clean as her faint salt flowers. <br>
         I would we twain were even as she, <br>
         Lost in the night and the light of the sea, <br>
         Where faint sounds falter and wan beams wade, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Break, and are broken, and shed into showers.<br>
         
         
         <center>43<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The loves and hours of the life of a man, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         They are swift and sad, being born of the sea. <br>
         Hours that rejoice and regret for a span, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Born with a man's breath, mortal as he; <br>
         Loves that are lost ere they come to birth, <br>
         Weeds of the wave, without fruit upon earth. <br>
         I lose what I long for, save what I can, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         My love, my love, and no love for me!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         It is not much that a man can save <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         On the sands of life, in the straits of time, <br>
         Who swims in sight of the great third wave <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That never a swimmer shall cross or climb. <br>
         Some waif washed up with the strays and spars <br>
         That ebb-tide shows to the shore and the stars; <br>
         Weed from the water, grass from a grave, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A broken blossom, a ruined rhyme.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There will no man do for your sake, I think, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What I would have done for the least word said. <br>
         I had wrung life dry for your lips to drink, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Broken it up for your daily bread; <br>
         Body for body and blood for blood, <br>
         As the flow of the full sea risen to flood <br>
         That yearns and trembles before it sink, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I had given, and lain down for you, glad and
         dead.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, hope at highest and all her fruit, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And time at fullest and all his dower, <br>
         
         <center>44<br></center>
         I had given you surely, and life to boot, <br>                
         
         &nbsp;
         Were we once made one for a single hour. <br>
         But now, you are twain, you are cloven apart, <br>
         Flesh of his flesh, but heart of my heart; <br>
         And deep in one is the bitter root, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And sweet for one is the lifelong flower.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         To have died if you cared I should die for you, clung <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To my life if you bade me, played my part <br>
         As it pleased you—these were the thoughts that stung, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The dreams that smote with a keener dart <br>
         Than shafts of love or arrows of death; <br>
         These were but as fire is, dust, or breath, <br>
         Or poisonous foam on the tender tongue <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of the little snakes that eat my heart.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I wish we were dead together to-day, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lost sight of, hidden away out of sight, <br>
         Clasped and clothed in the cloven clay, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Out of the world's way, out of the light, <br>
         Out of the ages of worldly weather, <br>
         Forgotten of all men altogether,<br>
         As the world's first dead, taken wholly away, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Made one with death, filled full of the night.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         How we should slumber, how we should sleep, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Far in the dark with the dreams and the dews! <br>
         And dreaming, grow to each other, and weep, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Laugh low, live softly, murmur and muse; <br>
         
         <center>45<br></center>
         Yea, and it may be, struck through by the dream, <br>
         Feel the dust quicken and quiver, and seem <br>
         Alive as of old to the lips, and leap <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Spirit to spirit as lovers use.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Sick dreams and sad of a dull delight; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For what shall it profit when men are dead <br>
         To have dreamed, to have loved with the whole soul's might, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To have looked for day when the day was fled? <br>
         Let come what will, there is one thing worth, <br>
         To have had fair love in the life upon earth: <br>
         To have held love safe till the day grew night, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         While skies had colour and lips were red.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Would I lose you now? would I take you then, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If I lose you now that my heart has need? <br>
         And come what may after death to men, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What thing worth this will the dead years breed? <br>
         Lose life, lose all; but at least I know, <br>
         O sweet life's love, having loved you so, <br>
         Had I reached you on earth, I should lose not again, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In death nor life, nor in dream or deed.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, I know this well: were you once sealed mine, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Mine in the blood's beat, mine in the breath, <br>
         Mixed into me as honey in wine, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Not time, that sayeth and gainsayeth,<br>
         
         <center>46<br></center>
         Nor all strong things had severed us then; <br>
         Not wrath of gods, nor wisdom of men, <br>
         Nor all things earthly, nor all divine, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor joy nor sorrow, nor life nor death.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I had grown pure as the dawn and the dew, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         You had grown strong as the sun or the sea. <br>
         But none shall triumph a whole life through: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For death is one, and the fates are three. <br>
         At the door of life, by the gate of breath, <br>
         There are worse things waiting for men than death; <br>
         Death could not sever my soul and you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As these have severed your soul from me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         You have chosen and clung to the chance they sent you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Life sweet as perfume and pure as prayer. <br>
         But will it not one day in heaven repent you? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Will they solace you wholly, the days that were? <br>
         Will you lift up your eyes between sadness and bliss, <br>
         Meet mine, and see where the great love is, <br>
         And tremble and turn and be changed? Content you; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The gate is strait; I shall not be there.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But you, had you chosen, had you stretched hand, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Had you seen good such a thing were done, <br>
         I too might have stood with the souls that stand <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the sun's sight, clothed with the light of the
         sun; <br>
         But who now on earth need care how I live? <br>
         Have the high gods anything left to give, <br>
         
         <center>47<br></center>
         Save dust and laurels and gold and sand? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Which gifts are goodly; but I will none.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O all fair lovers about the world, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There is none of you, none, that shall comfort me. <br>
         My thoughts are as dead things, wrecked and whirled <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Round and round in a gulf of the sea; <br>
         And still, through the sound and the straining stream, <br>
         Through the coil and chafe, they gleam in a dream, <br>
         The bright fine lips so cruelly curled, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And strange swift eyes where the soul sits free.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Free, without pity, withheld from woe, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ignorant; fair as the eyes are fair. <br>
         Would I have you change now, change at a blow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Startled and stricken, awake and aware? <br>
         Yea, if I could, would I have you see <br>
         My very love of you filling me, <br>
         And know my soul to the quick, as I know <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The likeness and look of your throat and hair?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I shall not change you. Nay, though I might, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Would I change my sweet one love with a word? <br>
         I had rather your hair should change in a night, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Clear now as the plume of a black bright bird; <br>
         Your face fail suddenly, cease, turn grey, <br>
         Die as a leaf that dies in a day. <br>
         I will keep my soul in a place out of sight, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Far off, where the pulse of it is not heard.<br>
         
         
         <center>48<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Far off it walks, in a bleak blown space, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Full of the sound of the sorrow of years. <br>
         I have woven a veil for the weeping face, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Whose lips have drunken the wine of tears; <br>
         I have found a way for the failing feet, <br>
         A place for slumber and sorrow to meet; <br>
         There is no rumour about the place, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor light, nor any that sees or hears.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I have hidden my soul out of sight, and said <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         "Let none take pity upon thee, none <br>
         Comfort thy crying: for lo, thou art dead, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lie still now, safe out of sight of the sun. <br>
         Have I not built thee a grave, and wrought <br>
         Thy grave-clothes on thee of grievous thought, <br>
         With soft spun verses and tears unshed, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And sweet light visions of things undone?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "I have given thee garments and balm and myrrh, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And gold, and beautiful burial things. <br>
         But thou, be at peace now, make no stir; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is not thy grave as a royal king's? <br>
         Fret not thyself though the end were sore; <br>
         Sleep, be patient, vex me no more. <br>
         Sleep; what hast thou to do with her? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The eyes that weep, with the mouth that sings?"<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Where the dead red leaves of the years lie rotten, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The cold old crimes and the deeds thrown by, <br>
         
         <center>49<br></center>
         The misconceived and the misbegotten, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I would find a sin to do ere I die, <br>
         Sure to dissolve and destroy me all through, <br>
         That would set you higher in heaven, serve you <br>
         And leave you happy, when clean forgotten, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As a dead man out of mind, am I.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Your lithe hands draw me, your face burns through me, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I am swift to follow you, keen to see; <br>
         But love lacks might to redeem or undo me; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As I have been, I know I shall surely be; <br>
         "What should such fellows as I do?" Nay, <br>
         My part were worse if I chose to play;<br>
         For the worst is this after all; if they knew me, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Not a soul upon earth would pity me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And I play not for pity of these; but you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If you saw with your soul what man am I, <br>
         You would praise me at least that my soul all through <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Clove to you, loathing the lives that lie; <br>
         The souls and lips that are bought and sold, <br>
         The smiles of silver and kisses of gold, <br>
         The lapdog loves that whine as they chew, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The little lovers that curse and cry.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There are fairer women, I hear; that may be; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But I, that I love you and find you fair, <br>
         Who are more than fair in my eyes if they be, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Do the high gods know or the great gods care? <br>
         
         <center>50<br></center>
         Though the swords in my heart for one were seven, <br>
         Should the iron hollow of doubtful heaven, <br>
         That knows not itself whether night-time or day be, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Reverberate words and a foolish prayer?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I will go back to the great sweet mother, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Mother and lover of men, the sea. <br>
         I will go down to her, I and none other, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Close with her, kiss her and mix her with me; <br>
         Cling to her, strive with her, hold her fast; <br>
         O fair white mother, in days long past <br>
         Born without sister, born without brother, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Set free my soul as thy soul is free.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O fair green-girdled mother of mine, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sea, that art clothed with the sun and the rain, <br>
         Thy sweet hard kisses are strong like wine, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy large embraces are keen like pain.<br>
         Save me and hide me with all thy waves, <br>
         Find me one grave of thy thousand graves, <br>
         Those pure cold populous graves of thine, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wrought without hand in a world without stain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I shall sleep, and move with the moving ships, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Change as the winds change, veer in the tide; <br>
         My lips will feast on the foam of thy lips, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I shall rise with thy rising, with thee subside; <br>
         Sleep, and not know if she be, if she were, <br>
         Filled full with life to the eyes and hair, <br>
         
         <center>51<br></center>
         As a rose is fulfilled to the roseleaf tips <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With splendid summer and perfume and pride.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         This woven raiment of nights and days, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Were it once cast off and unwound from me, <br>
         Naked and glad would I walk in thy ways, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Alive and aware of thy ways and thee; <br>
         Clear of the whole world, hidden at home, <br>
         Clothed with the green and crowned with the foam, <br>
         A pulse of the life of thy straits and bays, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A vein in the heart of the streams of the sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Fair mother, fed with the lives of men, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou art subtle and cruel of heart, men say. <br>
         Thou hast taken, and shalt not render again; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou art full of thy dead, and cold as they. <br>
         But death is the worst that comes of thee; <br>
         Thou art fed with our dead, O mother, O sea, <br>
         But when hast thou fed on our hearts? or when, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Having given us love, hast thou taken away?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O tender-hearted, O perfect lover, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy lips are bitter, and sweet thine heart.<br>
         The hopes that hurt and the dreams that hover, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall they not vanish away and apart? <br>
         But thou, thou art sure, thou art older than earth; <br>
         Thou art strong for death and fruitful of birth; <br>
         Thy depths conceal and thy gulfs discover; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From the first thou wert; in the end thou art.<br>
         
         
         <center>52<br></center>
         <br><br>
         And grief shall endure not for ever, I know. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As things that are not shall these things be; <br>
         We shall live through seasons of sun and of snow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And none be grievous as this to me. <br>
         We shall hear, as one in a trance that hears, <br>
         The sound of time, the rhyme of the years; <br>
         Wrecked hope and passionate pain will grow <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As tender things of a spring-tide sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Sea-fruit that swings in the waves that hiss, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Drowned gold and purple and royal rings. <br>
         And all time past, was it all for this? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Times unforgotten, and treasures of things? <br>
         Swift years of liking and sweet long laughter, <br>
         That wist not well of the years thereafter <br>
         Till love woke, smitten at heart by a kiss, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With lips that trembled and trailing wings?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There lived a singer in France of old <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         By the tideless dolorous midland sea. <br>
         In a land of sand and ruin and gold <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There shone one woman, and none but she. <br>
         And finding life for her love's sake fail, <br>
         Being fain to see her, he bade set sail, <br>
         Touched land, and saw her as life grew cold, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And praised God, seeing; and so died he.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Died, praising God for his gift and grace: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For she bowed down to him weeping, and said <br>
         
         <center>53<br></center>
         "Live"; and her tears were shed on his face <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or ever the life in his face was shed. <br>
         The sharp tears fell through her hair, and stung <br>
         Once, and her close lips touched him and clung <br>
         Once, and grew one with his lips for a space; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And so drew back, and the man was dead.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O brother, the gods were good to you. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sleep, and be glad while the world endures. <br>
         Be well content as the years wear through; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Give thanks for life, and the loves and lures; <br>
         Give thanks for life, O brother, and death, <br>
         For the sweet last sound of her feet, her breath, <br>
         For gifts she gave you, gracious and few, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Tears and kisses, that lady of yours.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Rest, and be glad of the gods; but I, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         How shall I praise them, or how take rest? <br>
         There is not room under all the sky <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For me that know not of worst or best, <br>
         Dream or desire of the days before, <br>
         Sweet things or bitterness, any more. <br>
         Love will not come to me now though I die, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As love came close to you, breast to breast.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I shall never be friends again with roses; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I shall loathe sweet tunes, where a note grown
         strong <br>
         Relents and recoils, and climbs and closes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As a wave of the sea turned back by song. <br>
         
         <center>54<br></center>
         There are sounds where the soul's delight takes fire, <br>
         Face to face with its own desire;<br>
         A delight that rebels, a desire that reposes; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I shall hate sweet music my whole life long.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The pulse of war and passion of wonder, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The heavens that murmur, the sounds that shine, <br>
         The stars that sing and the loves that thunder, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The music burning at heart like wine, <br>
         An armed archangel whose hands raise up <br>
         All senses mixed in the spirit's cup <br>
         Till flesh and spirit are molten in sunder — <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         These things are over, and no more mine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         These were a part of the playing I heard <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Once, ere my love and my heart were at strife; <br>
         Love that sings and hath wings as a bird, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Balm of the wound and heft of the knife. <br>
         Fairer than earth is the sea, and sleep <br>
         Than overwatching of eyes that weep, <br>
         Now time has done with his one sweet word, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The wine and leaven of lovely life.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I shall go my ways, tread out my measure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fill the days of my daily breath <br>
         With fugitive things not good to treasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Do as the world doth, say as it saith; <br>
         But if we had loved each other—O sweet, <br>
         Had you felt, lying under the palms of your feet, <br>
         
         <center>55<br></center>
         The heart of my heart, beating harder with pleasure <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To feel you tread it to dust and death— <br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah, had I not taken my life up and given <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All that life gives and the years let go, <br>
         The wine and honey, the balm and leaven, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The dreams reared high and the hopes brought low?<br>
         Come life, come death, not a word be said; <br>
         Should I lose you living, and vex you dead? <br>
         I never shall tell you on earth; and in heaven, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If I cry to you then, will you hear or know? <br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Whatever</span> a man of the sons of men <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall say to his heart of the lords above, <br>
         They have shown man verily, once and again, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Marvellous mercies and infinite love.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In the wild fifth year of the change of things, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When France was glorious and blood-red, fair <br>
         With dust of battle and deaths of kings, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A queen of men, with helmeted hair,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Carrier came down to the Loire and slew, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till all the ways and the waves waxed red: <br>
         Bound and drowned, slaying two by two, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Maidens and young men, naked and wed.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They brought on a day to his judgment-place <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One rough with labour and red with fight, <br>
         And a lady noble by name and face, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Faultless, a maiden, wonderful, white.<br>
         
         
         <center>57<br></center>
         <br><br>
         She knew not, being for shame's sake blind, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If his eyes were hot on her face hard by. <br>
         And the judge bade strip and ship them, and bind <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Bosom to bosom, to drown and die.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The white girl winced and whitened; but he <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Caught fire, waxed bright as a great bright flame <br>
         Seen with thunder far out on the sea, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Laughed hard as the glad blood went and came.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Twice his lips quailed with delight, then said, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         "I have but a word to you all, one word; <br>
         Bear with me; surely I am but dead;" <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And all they laughed and mocked him and heard.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "Judge, when they open the judgment-roll, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I will stand upright before God and pray: <br>
         'Lord God, have mercy on one man's soul, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For his mercy was great upon earth, I say.<br>

         &nbsp;
         A hand's-breadth, Lord, in the perilous place— <br>

         "'I pray thee say to this man, O Lord, <br>

         I will face thy wrath, though it bite as a sword, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And my soul shall burn for his soul, and atone.<br>

         "'For, Lord, thou knowest, O God most wise, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         How gracious on earth were his deeds towards me. <br>
         Shall this be a small thing in thine eyes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That is greater in mine than the whole great
         sea?'<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "I have loved this woman my whole life long, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And even for love's sake when have I said <br>
         'I love you'? when have I done you wrong, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Living? but now I shall have you dead.<br>

         Love me or loathe, we are one not twain. <br>
         But God be praised in his heaven above <br>

         For this my pleasure and that my pain!<br>

         "For never a man, being mean like me, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall die like me till the whole world dies. <br>
         I shall drown with her, laughing for love; and she <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Mix with me, touching me, lips and eyes.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "Shall she not know me and see me all through, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Me, on whose heart as a worm she trod? <br>
         You have given me, God requite it you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What man yet never was given of God."<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O sweet one love, O my life's delight, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Dear, though the days have divided us, <br>
         Lost beyond hope, taken far out of sight, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Not twice in the world shall the gods do thus.<br>
         
         
         <center>59<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Had it been so hard for my love? but I, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though the gods gave all that a god can give, <br>
         I had chosen rather the gift to die, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Cease, and be glad above all that live.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For the Loire would have driven us down to the sea, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the sea would have pitched us from shoal to
         shoal; <br>
         And I should have held you, and you held me, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As flesh holds flesh, and the soul the soul.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Could I change you, help you to love me, sweet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Could I give you the love that would sweeten death,<br>
         We should yield, go down, locked hands and feet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Die, drown together, and breath catch breath;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But you would have felt my soul in a kiss, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And known that once if I loved you well; <br>
         And I would have given my soul for this <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To burn for ever in burning hell. <br>

         <h3>A LEAVE-TAKING</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Let</span> us go hence, my songs; she will not hear. <br>
         Let us go hence together without fear; <br>
         Keep silence now, for singing-time is over, <br>
         And over all old things and all things dear. <br>
         She loves not you nor me as all we love her. <br>
         Yea, though we sang as angels in her ear, <br>
         She would not hear.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let us rise up and part; she will not know. <br>
         Let us go seaward as the great winds go, <br>
         Full of blown sand and foam; what help is here? <br>
         There is no help, for all these things are so, <br>
         And all the world is bitter as a tear. <br>
         And how these things are, though ye strove to show, <br>
         She would not know.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let us go home and hence; she will not weep. <br>
         We gave love many dreams and days to keep, <br>
         Flowers without scent, and fruits that would not grow, <br>
         Saying `If thou wilt, thrust in thy sickle and reap.' <br>
         
         <center>61<br></center>All is reaped now; no grass is left to mow; <br>
         And we that sowed, though all we fell on sleep, <br>
         She would not weep.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let us go hence and rest; she will not love. <br>
         She shall not hear us if we sing hereof, <br>
         Nor see love's ways, how sore they are and steep. <br>
         Come hence, let be, lie still; it is enough. <br>
         Love is a barren sea, bitter and deep; <br>
         And though she saw all heaven in flower above, <br>
         She would not love.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let us give up, go down; she will not care. <br>
         Though all the stars made gold of all the air, <br>
         And the sea moving saw before it move <br>
         One moon-flower making all the foam-flowers fair; <br>
         Though all those waves went over us, and drove <br>
         Deep down the stifling lips and drowning hair, <br>
         She would not care.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let us go hence, go hence; she will not see. <br>
         Sing all once more together; surely she, <br>
         She too, remembering days and words that were, <br>
         Will turn a little toward us, sighing; but we, <br>
         We are hence, we are gone, as though we had not been there. <br>
         Nay, and though all men seeing had pity on me, <br>
         She would not see. <br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Swallow</span>, my sister, O sister swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         How can thine heart be full of the spring? <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         A thousand summers are over and dead. <br>
         What hast thou found in the spring to follow? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What hast thou found in thine heart to sing? <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         What wilt thou do when the summer is shed?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O swallow, sister, O fair swift swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Why wilt thou fly after spring to the south, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The soft south whither thine heart is set? <br>
         Shall not the grief of the old time follow? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall not the song thereof cleave to thy mouth? <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Hast thou forgotten ere I forget?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Sister, my sister, O fleet sweet swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy way is long to the sun and the south; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But I, fulfilled of my heart's desire, <br>
         Shedding my song upon height, upon hollow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From tawny body and sweet small mouth <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Feed the heart of the night with fire.<br>
          
         <center>63<br></center>
         <br><br>
         I the nightingale all spring through, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O swallow, sister, O changing swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         All spring through till the spring be done, <br>
         Clothed with the light of the night on the dew, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sing, while the hours and the wild birds follow, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Take flight and follow and find the sun.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Sister, my sister, O soft light swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though all things feast in the spring's
         guest-chamber, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         How hast thou heart to be glad thereof yet? <br>
         For where thou fliest I shall not follow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till life forget and death remember, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Till thou remember and I forget.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Swallow, my sister, O singing swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I know not how thou hast heart to sing. <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Hast thou the heart? is it all past over? <br>
         Thy lord the summer is good to follow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And fair the feet of thy lover the spring: <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But what wilt thou say to the spring thy lover?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O swallow, sister, O fleeting swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         My heart in me is a molten ember <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And over my head the waves have met. <br>
         But thou wouldst tarry or I would follow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Could I forget or thou remember, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Couldst thou remember and I forget.<br>
          
         <center>64<br></center>
         <br><br>
         O sweet stray sister, O shifting swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The heart's division divideth us. <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thy heart is light as a leaf of a tree; <br>
         But mine goes forth among sea-gulfs hollow <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To the place of the slaying of Itylus, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The feast of Daulis, the Thracian sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O swallow, sister, O rapid swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I pray thee sing not a little space. <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Are not the roofs and the lintels wet? <br>
         The woven web that was plain to follow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The small slain body, the flowerlike face, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Can I remember if thou forget?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O sister, sister, thy first-begotten! <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The hands that cling and the feet that follow, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The voice of the child's blood crying yet <br>
         
         Who hath remembered me? who hath forgotten?
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou hast forgotten, O summer swallow, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But the world shall end when I forget. <br>

         Sappho.
         
         
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">My</span> life is bitter with thy love; thine eyes <br>
         Blind me, thy tresses burn me, thy sharp sighs <br>
         Divide my flesh and spirit with soft sound, <br>
         And my blood strengthens, and my veins abound. <br>
         I pray thee sigh not, speak not, draw not breath; <br>
         Let life burn down, and dream it is not death. <br>
         I would the sea had hidden us, the fire <br>
         (Wilt thou fear that, and fear not my desire?) <br>
         Severed the bones that bleach, the flesh that cleaves, <br>
         And let our sifted ashes drop like leaves. <br>
         I feel thy blood against my blood: my pain <br>
         Pains thee, and lips bruise lips, and vein stings vein. <br>
         Let fruit be crushed on fruit, let flower on flower, <br>
         Breast kindle breast, and either burn one hour. <br>
         Why wilt thou follow lesser loves? are thine <br>
         Too weak to bear these hands and lips of mine? <br>
         I charge thee for my life's sake, O too sweet <br>
         To crush love with thy cruel faultless feet, <br>
         
         <center>66<br></center>
         I charge thee keep thy lips from hers or his, <br>
         Sweetest, till theirs be sweeter than my kiss: <br>
         Lest I too lure, a swallow for a dove, <br>
         Erotion or Erinna to my love.<br>
         I would my love could kill thee; I am satiated <br>
         With seeing the live, and fain would have thee dead. <br>
         I would earth had thy body as fruit to eat, <br>
         And no mouth but some serpent's found thee sweet. <br>
         I would find grievous ways to have thee slain, <br>
         Intense device, and superflux of pain; <br>
         Vex thee with amorous agonies, and shake <br>
         Life at thy lips, and leave it there to ache; <br>
         Strain out thy soul with pangs too soft to kill, <br>
         Intolerable interludes, and infinite ill; <br>
         Relapse and reluctation of the breath, <br>
         Dumb tunes and shuddering semitones of death. <br>
         I am weary of all thy words and soft strange ways, <br>
         Of all love's fiery nights and all his days, <br>
         And all the broken kisses salt as brine <br>
         That shuddering lips make moist with waterish wine, <br>
         And eyes the bluer for all those hidden hours <br>
         That pleasure fills with tears and feeds from flowers, <br>
         Fierce at the heart with fire that half comes through, <br>
         But all the flower-like white stained round with blue; <br>
         The fervent underlid, and that above <br>
         Lifted with laughter or abashed with love; <br>
         Thine amorous girdle, full of thee and fair, <br>
         And leavings of the lilies in thine hair. <br>
         
         <center>67<br></center>
         Yea, all sweet words of thine and all thy ways, <br>
         And all the fruit of nights and flower of days, <br>
         And stinging lips wherein the hot sweet brine <br>
         That Love was born of burns and foams like wine, <br>
         And eyes insatiable of amorous hours, <br>
         Fervent as fire and delicate as flowers, <br>
         Coloured like night at heart, but cloven through <br>
         Like night with flame, dyed round like night with blue,<br>
         Clothed with deep eyelids under and above— <br>
         Yea, all thy beauty sickens me with love; <br>
         Thy girdle empty of thee and now not fair, <br>
         And ruinous lilies in thy languid hair. <br>
         Ah, take no thought for Love's sake; shall this be, <br>
         And she who loves thy lover not love thee? <br>
         Sweet soul, sweet mouth of all that laughs and lives, <br>
         Mine is she, very mine; and she forgives. <br>
         For I beheld in sleep the light that is <br>
         In her high place in Paphos, heard the kiss <br>
         Of body and soul that mix with eager tears <br>
         And laughter stinging through the eyes and ears; <br>
         Saw Love, as burning flame from crown to feet, <br>
         Imperishable, upon her storied seat; <br>
         Clear eyelids lifted toward the north and south, <br>
         A mind of many colours, and a mouth <br>
         Of many tunes and kisses; and she bowed, <br>
         With all her subtle face laughing aloud, <br>
         Bowed down upon me, saying, ‘Who doth thee wrong, <br>
         Sappho?’ but thou—thy body is the song, <br>
         
         <center>68<br></center>
         Thy mouth the music; thou art more than I, <br>
         Though my voice die not till the whole world die; <br>
         Though men that hear it madden; though love weep, <br>
         Though nature change, though shame be charmed asleep. <br>
         Ah, wilt thou slay me lest I kiss thee dead? <br>
         Yet the queen laughed from her sweet heart and said: <br>
         ‘Even she that flies shall follow for thy sake, <br>
         And she shall give thee gifts that would not take, <br>
         Shall kiss that would not kiss thee’ (yea, kiss me) <br>
         ‘When thou wouldst not’—when I would not kiss
         thee!<br>
         Ah, more to me than all men as thou art, <br>
         Shall not my songs assuage her at the heart? <br>
         Ah, sweet to me as life seems sweet to death, <br>
         Why should her wrath fill thee with fearful breath? <br>
         Nay, sweet, for is she God alone? hath she <br>
         Made earth and all the centuries of the sea, <br>
         Taught the sun ways to travel, woven most fine <br>
         The moonbeams, shed the starbeams forth as wine, <br>
         Bound with her myrtles, beaten with her rods, <br>
         The young men and the maidens and the gods? <br>
         Have we not lips to love with, eyes for tears, <br>
         And summer and flower of women and of years? <br>
         Stars for the foot of morning, and for noon <br>
         Sunlight, and exaltation of the moon; <br>
         Waters that answer waters, fields that wear <br>
         Lilies, and languor of the Lesbian air? <br>
         Beyond those flying feet of fluttered doves, <br>
         Are there not other gods for other loves? <br>
         
         <center>69<br></center>
         Yea, though she scourge thee, sweetest, for my sake, <br>
         Blossom not thorns and flowers not blood should break. <br>
         Ah that my lips were tuneless lips, but pressed <br>
         To the bruised blossom of thy scourged white breast! <br>
         Ah that my mouth for Muses' milk were fed <br>
         On the sweet blood thy sweet small wounds had bled! <br>
         That with my tongue I felt them, and could taste <br>
         The faint flakes from thy bosom to the waist! <br>
         That I could drink thy veins as wine, and eat <br>
         Thy breasts like honey! that from face to feet <br>
         Thy body were abolished and consumed, <br>
         And in my flesh thy very flesh entombed!<br>
         Ah, ah, thy beauty! like a beast it bites, <br>
         Stings like an adder, like an arrow smites. <br>
         Ah sweet, and sweet again, and seven times sweet, <br>
         The paces and the pauses of thy feet! <br>
         Ah sweeter than all sleep or summer air <br>
         The fallen fillets fragrant from thine hair! <br>
         Yea, though their alien kisses do me wrong, <br>
         Sweeter thy lips than mine with all their song; <br>
         Thy shoulders whiter than a fleece of white, <br>
         And flower-sweet fingers, good to bruise or bite <br>
         As honeycomb of the inmost honey-cells, <br>
         With almond-shaped and roseleaf-coloured shells, <br>
         And blood like purple blossom at the tips <br>
         Quivering; and pain made perfect in thy lips <br>
         For my sake when I hurt thee; O that I <br>
         Durst crush thee out of life with love, and die, <br> 
         <center>70<br></center>
         Die of thy pain and my delight, and be <br>
         Mixed with thy blood and molten into thee! <br>
         Would I not plague thee dying overmuch? <br>
         Would I not hurt thee perfectly? not touch <br>
         Thy pores of sense with torture, and make bright <br>
         Thine eyes with bloodlike tears and grievous light? <br>
         Strike pang from pang as note is struck from note, <br>
         Catch the sob's middle music in thy throat, <br>
         Take thy limbs living, and new-mould with these <br>
         A lyre of many faultless agonies? <br>
         Feed thee with fever and famine and fine drouth, <br>
         With perfect pangs convulse thy perfect mouth, <br>
         Make thy life shudder in thee and burn afresh, <br>
         And wring thy very spirit through the flesh? <br>
         Cruel? but love makes all that love him well <br>
         As wise as heaven and crueller than hell. <br>
         Me hath love made more bitter toward thee <br>
         Than death toward man; but were I made as he<br>
         Who hath made all things to break them one by one, <br>
         If my feet trod upon the stars and sun <br>
         And souls of men as his have alway trod, <br>
         God knows I might be crueller than God. <br>
         For who shall change with prayers or thanksgivings <br>
         The mystery of the cruelty of things? <br>
         Or say what God above all gods and years, <br>
         With offering and blood-sacrifice of tears, <br>
         With lamentation from strange lands, from graves <br>
         Where the snake pastures, from scarred mouths of slaves, <br>
         
         <center>71<br></center>
         From prison, and from plunging prows of ships <br>
         Through flamelike foam of the sea's closing lips— <br>
         With thwartings of strange signs, and wind-blown hair <br>
         Of comets, desolating the dim air, <br>
         When darkness is made fast with seals and bars, <br>
         And fierce reluctance of disastrous stars, <br>
         Eclipse, and sound of shaken hills, and wings <br>
         Darkening, and blind inexpiable things— <br>
         With sorrow of labouring moons, and altering light <br>
         And travail of the planets of the night, <br>
         And weeping of the weary Pleiads seven, <br>
         Feeds the mute melancholy lust of heaven? <br>
         Is not his incense bitterness, his meat <br>
         Murder? his hidden face and iron feet <br>
         Hath not man known, and felt them on their way <br>
         Threaten and trample all things and every day? <br>
         Hath he not sent us hunger? who hath cursed <br>
         Spirit and flesh with longing? filled with thirst <br>
         Their lips who cried unto him? who bade exceed <br>
         The fervid will, fall short the feeble deed, <br>
         Bade sink the spirit and the flesh aspire, <br>
         Pain animate the dust of dead desire,<br>
         And life yield up her flower to violent fate? <br>
         Him would I reach, him smite, him desecrate, <br>
         Pierce the cold lips of God with human breath, <br>
         And mix his immortality with death. <br>
         Why hath he made us? what had all we done <br>
         That we should live and loathe the sterile sun, <br> 
         
         <center>72<br></center>
         And with the moon wax paler as she wanes, <br>
         And pulse by pulse feel time grow through our veins? <br>
         Thee too the years shall cover; thou shalt be <br>
         As the rose born of one same blood with thee, <br>
         As a song sung, as a word said, and fall <br>
         Flower-wise, and be not any more at all, <br>
         Nor any memory of thee anywhere; <br>
         For never Muse has bound above thine hair <br>
         The high Pierian flower whose graft outgrows <br>
         All summer kinship of the mortal rose <br>
         And colour of deciduous days, nor shed <br>
         Reflex and flush of heaven about thine head, <br>
         Nor reddened brows made pale by floral grief <br>
         With splendid shadow from that lordlier leaf. <br>
         Yea, thou shalt be forgotten like spilt wine, <br>
         Except these kisses of my lips on thine <br>
         Brand them with immortality; but me— <br>
         Men shall not see bright fire nor hear the sea, <br>
         Nor mix their hearts with music, nor behold <br>
         Cast forth of heaven with feet of awful gold <br>
         And plumeless wings that make the bright air blind, <br>
         Lightning, with thunder for a hound behind <br>
         Hunting through fields unfurrowed and unsown— <br>
         But in the light and laughter, in the moan <br>
         And music, and in grasp of lip and hand <br>
         And shudder of water that makes felt on land<br>
         The immeasurable tremor of all the sea, <br>
         Memories shall mix and metaphors of me. <br> 
         
         <center>73<br></center>
         Like me shall be the shuddering calm of night, <br>
         When all the winds of the world for pure delight <br>
         Close lips that quiver and fold up wings that ache; <br>
         When nightingales are louder for love's sake, <br>
         And leaves tremble like lute-strings or like fire; <br>
         Like me the one star swooning with desire <br>
         Even at the cold lips of the sleepless moon, <br>
         As I at thine; like me the waste white noon, <br>
         Burnt through with barren sunlight; and like me <br>
         The land-stream and the tide-stream in the sea. <br>
         I am sick with time as these with ebb and flow, <br>
         And by the yearning in my veins I know <br>
         The yearning sound of waters; and mine eyes <br>
         Burn as that beamless fire which fills the skies <br>
         With troubled stars and travailing things of flame; <br>
         And in my heart the grief consuming them <br>
         Labours, and in my veins the thirst of these, <br>
         And all the summer travail of the trees <br>
         And all the winter sickness; and the earth, <br>
         Filled full with deadly works of death and birth, <br>
         Sore spent with hungry lusts of birth and death, <br>
         Has pain like mine in her divided breath; <br>
         Her spring of leaves is barren, and her fruit <br>
         Ashes; her boughs are burdened, and her root <br>
         Fibrous and gnarled with poison; underneath <br>
         Serpents have gnawn it through with tortuous teeth <br>
         Made sharp upon the bones of all the dead, <br>
         And wild birds rend her branches overhead. <br> 
         
         <center>74<br></center>
         These, woven as raiment for his word and thought, <br>
         These hath God made, and me as these, and wrought <br>
         Song, and hath lit it at my lips; and me <br>
         Earth shall not gather though she feed on thee.<br>
         As a shed tear shalt thou be shed; but I— <br>
         Lo, earth may labour, men live long and die, <br>
         Years change and stars, and the high God devise <br>
         New things, and old things wane before his eyes <br>
         Who wields and wrecks them, being more strong than they— <br>
         But, having made me, me he shall not slay. <br>
         Nor slay nor satiate, like those herds of his <br>
         Who laugh and live a little, and their kiss <br>
         Contents them, and their loves are swift and sweet, <br>
         And sure death grasps and gains them with slow feet, <br>
         Love they or hate they, strive or bow their knees— <br>
         And all these end; he hath his will of these. <br>
         Yea, but albeit he slay me, hating me— <br>
         Albeit he hide me in the deep dear sea <br>
         And cover me with cool wan foam, and ease <br>
         This soul of mine as any soul of these, <br>
         And give me water and great sweet waves, and make <br>
         The very sea's name lordlier for my sake, <br>
         The whole sea sweeter—albeit I die indeed <br>
         And hide myself and sleep and no man heed, <br>
         Of me the high God hath not all his will. <br>
         Blossom of branches, and on each high hill <br> 
         
         <center>75<br></center>
         Clear air and wind, and under in clamorous vales <br>
         Fierce noises of the fiery nightingales, <br>
         Buds burning in the sudden spring like fire, <br>
         The wan washed sand and the waves' vain desire, <br>
         Sails seen like blown white flowers at sea, and words <br>
         That bring tears swiftest, and long notes of birds <br>
         Violently singing till the whole world sings— <br>
         I Sappho shall be one with all these things, <br>
         With all high things for ever; and my face <br>
         Seen once, my songs once heard in a strange place,<br>
         Cleave to men's lives, and waste the days thereof <br>
         With gladness and much sadness and long love. <br>
         Yea, they shall say, earth's womb has borne in vain <br>
         New things, and never this best thing again; <br>
         Borne days and men, borne fruits and wars and wine, <br>
         Seasons and songs, but no song more like mine. <br>
         And they shall know me as ye who have known me here, <br>
         Last year when I loved Atthis, and this year <br>
         When I love thee; and they shall praise me, and say <br>
         ‘She hath all time as all we have our day, <br>
         Shall she not live and have her will’—even I? <br>
         Yea, though thou diest, I say I shall not die. <br>
         For these shall give me of their souls, shall give <br>
         Life, and the days and loves wherewith I live, <br>
         Shall quicken me with loving, fill with breath, <br>
         Save me and serve me, strive for me with death. <br>
         Alas, that neither moon nor snow nor dew <br>
         Nor all cold things can purge me wholly through, <br>
         
         <center>76<br></center>
         Assuage me nor allay me nor appease, <br>
         Till supreme sleep shall bring me bloodless ease; <br>
         Till time wax faint in all his periods; <br>
         Till fate undo the bondage of the gods, <br>
         And lay, to slake and satiate me all through, <br>
         Lotus and Lethe on my lips like dew, <br>
         And shed around and over and under me <br>
         Thick darkness and the insuperable sea. <br>

         <h3>HYMN TO PROSERPINE</h3>
         
         <h3>(AFTER THE PROCLAMATION IN ROME OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH.)</h3>
         
         Vicisti, Galilæe.
         
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">I have</span> lived long enough, having seen one thing, that love
         hath an end; <br>
         Goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and befriend. <br>
         Thou art more than the day or the morrow, the seasons that laugh
         or that weep; <br>
         For these give joy and sorrow; but thou, Proserpina, sleep. <br>
         Sweet is the treading of wine, and sweet the feet of the dove; <br>
         But a goodlier gift is thine than foam of the grapes or love. <br>
         Yea, is not even Apollo, with hair and harpstring of gold, <br>
         A bitter God to follow, a beautiful God to behold? <br>
         I am sick of singing: the bays burn deep and chafe: I am fain <br>
         To rest a little from praise and grievous pleasure and pain. <br>
         For the Gods we know not of, who give us our daily breath, <br>
         We know they are cruel as love or life, and lovely as death.<br>
         
         <center>78<br></center>
         O Gods dethroned and deceased, cast forth, wiped out in a day! <br>
         From your wrath is the world released, redeemed from your chains,
         men say. <br>
         New Gods are crowned in the city; their flowers have broken your
         rods; <br>
         They are merciful, clothed with pity, the young compassionate
         Gods. <br>
         But for me their new device is barren, the days are bare; <br>
         Things long past over suffice, and men forgotten that were. <br>
         Time and the Gods are at strife; ye dwell in the midst thereof, <br>
         Draining a little life from the barren breasts of love. <br>
         I say to you, cease, take rest; yea, I say to you all, be at
         peace, <br>
         Till the bitter milk of her breast and the barren bosom shall
         cease. <br>
         Wilt thou yet take all, Galilean? but these thou shalt not take, <br>
         The laurel, the palms and the pæan, the breasts of the nymphs in
         the brake; <br>
         Breasts more soft than a dove's, that tremble with tenderer
         breath; <br>
         And all the wings of the Loves, and all the joy before death; <br>
         All the feet of the hours that sound as a single lyre, <br>
         Dropped and deep in the flowers, with strings that flicker like
         fire. <br> 
         
         <center>79<br></center>
         More than these wilt thou give, things fairer than all these
         things? <br>
         Nay, for a little we live, and life hath mutable wings.<br>
         A little while and we die; shall life not thrive as it may? <br>
         For no man under the sky lives twice, outliving his day. <br>
         And grief is a grievous thing, and a man hath enough of his
         tears: <br>
         Why should he labour, and bring fresh grief to blacken his years? <br>
         Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey
         from thy breath; <br>
         We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fulness of
         death. <br>
         Laurel is green for a season, and love is sweet for a day; <br>
         But love grows bitter with treason, and laurel outlives not May. <br>
         Sleep, shall we sleep after all? for the world is not sweet in
         the end; <br>
         For the old faiths loosen and fall, the new years ruin and rend. <br>
         Fate is a sea without shore, and the soul is a rock that abides; <br>
         But her ears are vexed with the roar and her face with the foam
         of the tides. <br>
         O lips that the live blood faints in, the leavings of racks and
         rods! <br>
         O ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted Gods! <br>
         
         <center>80<br></center>
         Though all men abase them before you in spirit, and all knees
         bend, <br>
         I kneel not neither adore you, but standing, look to the end. <br>
         All delicate days and pleasant, all spirits and sorrows are cast <br>
         Far out with the foam of the present that sweeps to the surf of
         the past:<br>
         Where beyond the extreme sea-wall, and between the remote
         sea-gates, <br>
         Waste water washes, and tall ships founder, and deep death waits: <br>
         Where, mighty with deepening sides, clad about with the seas as
         with wings, <br>
         And impelled of invisible tides, and fulfilled of unspeakable
         things, <br>
         White-eyed and poisonous-finned, shark-toothed and
         serpentine-curled, <br>
         Rolls, under the whitening wind of the future, the wave of the
         world. <br>
         The depths stand naked in sunder behind it, the storms flee away; <br>
         In the hollow before it the thunder is taken and snared as a
         prey; <br>
         In its sides is the north-wind bound; and its salt is of all
         men's tears; <br>
         With light of ruin, and sound of changes, and pulse of years: <br>
         
         <center>81<br></center>
         With travail of day after day, and with trouble of hour upon
         hour; <br>
         And bitter as blood is the spray; and the crests are as fangs
         that devour: <br>
         And its vapour and storm of its steam as the sighing of spirits
         to be; <br>
         And its noise as the noise in a dream; and its depth as the roots
         of the sea: <br>
         And the height of its heads as the height of the utmost stars of
         the air: <br>
         And the ends of the earth at the might thereof tremble, and time
         is made bare. <br>
         Will ye bridle the deep sea with reins, will ye chasten the high
         sea with rods?<br>
         Will ye take her to chain her with chains, who is older than all
         ye Gods? <br>
         All ye as a wind shall go by, as a fire shall ye pass and be
         past; <br>
         Ye are Gods, and behold, ye shall die, and the waves be upon you
         at last. <br>
         In the darkness of time, in the deeps of the years, in the
         changes of things, <br>
         Ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps, and the world shall forget
         you for kings. <br>
         Though the feet of thine high priests tread where thy lords and
         our forefathers trod, <br>
         Though these that were Gods are dead, and thou being dead art a
         God, <br>
         
         <center>82<br></center>
         Though before thee the throned Cytherean be fallen, and hidden
         her head, <br>
         Yet thy kingdom shall pass, Galilean, thy dead shall go down to
         thee dead. <br>
         Of the maiden thy mother men sing as a goddess with grace clad
         around; <br>
         Thou art throned where another was king; where another was queen
         she is crowned. <br>
         Yea, once we had sight of another: but now she is queen, say
         these. <br>
         Not as thine, not as thine was our mother, a blossom of flowering
         seas, <br>
         Clothed round with the world's desire as with raiment, and fair
         as the foam, <br>
         And fleeter than kindled fire, and a goddess, and mother of Rome. <br>
         For thine came pale and a maiden, and sister to sorrow; but ours, <br>
         Her deep hair heavily laden with odour and colour of flowers,<br>
         White rose of the rose-white water, a silver splendour, a flame, <br>
         Bent down unto us that besought her, and earth grew sweet with
         her name. <br>
         For thine came weeping, a slave among slaves, and rejected; but
         she <br>
         Came flushed from the full-flushed wave, and imperial, her foot
         on the sea. <br>
         And the wonderful waters knew her, the winds and the viewless
         ways, <br>
         
         <center>83<br></center>
         And the roses grew rosier, and bluer the sea-blue stream of the
         bays. <br>
         Ye are fallen, our lords, by what token? we wist that ye should
         not fall. <br>
         Ye were all so fair that are broken; and one more fair than ye
         all. <br>
         But I turn to her still, having seen she shall surely abide in
         the end; <br>
         Goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and befriend. <br>
         O daughter of earth, of my mother, her crown and blossom of
         birth, <br>
         I am also, I also, thy brother; I go as I came unto earth. <br>
         In the night where thine eyes are as moons are in heaven, the
         night where thou art, <br>
         Where the silence is more than all tunes, where sleep overflows
         from the heart, <br>
         Where the poppies are sweet as the rose in our world, and the red
         rose is white, <br>
         And the wind falls faint as it blows with the fume of the flowers
         of the night, <br>
         And the murmur of spirits that sleep in the shadow of Gods from
         afar<br>
         Grows dim in thine ears and deep as the deep dim soul of a star, <br>
         
         <center>84<br></center>
         In the sweet low light of thy face, under heavens untrod by the
         sun, <br>
         Let my soul with their souls find place, and forget what is done
         and undone. <br>
         Thou art more than the Gods who number the days of our temporal
         breath; <br>
         For these give labour and slumber; but thou, Proserpina, death. <br>
         Therefore now at thy feet I abide for a season in silence. I
         know <br>
         I shall die as my fathers died, and sleep as they sleep; even
         so. <br>
         For the glass of the years is brittle wherein we gaze for a
         span; <br>
         A little soul for a little bears up this corpse which is
         man.φ
         <br>
         So long I endure, no longer; and laugh not again, neither weep. <br>
         For there is no God found stronger than death; and death is a
         sleep. <br>

         Peace all day long, all night, all morrow, <br>

         But never a time to laugh or weep. <br>
         The end is come of pleasant places, <br>
         The end of tender words and faces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The end of all, the poppied sleep.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         No place for sound within their hearing, <br>
         No room to hope, no time for fearing, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No lips to laugh, no lids for tears. <br>
         The old years have run out all their measure; <br>
         No chance of pain, no chance of pleasure, <br>

         There where the slayer is clean of blood, <br>
         No end, no passage, no beginning, <br>
         There where the sinner leaves off sinning, <br>

         My brother, I am one with thee: <br>
         They shall not strive nor cry for ever: <br>
         No man shall choose between them: never <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall this thing end and that thing be.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Wind wherein seas and stars are shaken <br>
         Shall shake them, and they shall not waken; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         None that has lain down shall arise; <br>
         The stones are sealed across their places; <br>
         One shadow is shed on all their faces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One blindness cast on all their eyes.<br>

         Each face, as each face were his lover's? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Farewell; as men that sleep fare well. <br>
         The grave's mouth laughs unto derision <br>
         Desire and dread and dream and vision, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Delight of heaven and sorrow of hell.<br>

         No memory, no memorial. <br>
         "Thou knowest"—who shall say thou knowest? <br>
         There is none highest and none lowest: <br>

         Good night, good sleep, good rest from sorrow <br>

         The gods be gentle to all these. <br>
         Nay, if death be not, how shall they be? <br>
         Nay, is there help in heaven? it may be <br>

         All things and lords of things shall cease.<br>

         The bronzèd brims are deep in ashes; <br>

         The pale old lips of death are fed. <br>
         Shall this dust gather flesh hereafter? <br>

         &nbsp;
         At sight of all these poor old dead?<br>

         Nay, as thou wilt; these know not of it; <br>
         Thine eyes' strong weeping shall not profit, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy laughter shall not give thee ease; <br>
         Cry aloud, spare not, cease not crying, <br>
         Sigh, till thou cleave thy sides with sighing, <br>

         Burnt spices flash, and burnt wine hisses, <br>
         The breathing flame's mouth curls and kisses <br>

         The small dried rows of frankincense; <br>
         All round the sad red blossoms smoulder, <br>
         Flowers coloured like the fire, but colder, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In sign of sweet things taken hence;<br>

         Things of sweet shape and of sweet savour <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We yield them, spice and flower and wine; <br>
         Yea, costlier things than wine or spices, <br>
         
         <center>88<br></center>
         Whereof none knoweth how great the price is, <br>

         And fruit that comes not of the vine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         From boy's pierced throat and girl's pierced bosom <br>
         Drips, reddening round the blood-red blossom, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The slow delicious bright soft blood, <br>
         Bathing the spices and the pyre, <br>
         Bathing the flowers and fallen fire, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Bathing the blossom by the bud.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Roses whose lips the flame has deadened <br>
         Drink till the lapping leaves are reddened <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And warm wet inner petals weep; <br>
         The flower whereof sick sleep gets leisure, <br>
         Barren of balm and purple pleasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fumes with no native steam of sleep.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Why will ye weep? what do ye weeping? <br>
         For waking folk and people sleeping, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And sands that fill and sands that fall, <br>
         The days rose-red, the poppied hours, <br>
         Blood, wine, and spice and fire and flowers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There is one end of one and all.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Shall such an one lend love or borrow? <br>
         Shall these be sorry for thy sorrow? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall these give thanks for words or breath? <br>
         Their hate is as their loving-kindness; <br>
         The frontlet of their brows is blindness, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The armlet of their arms is death.<br>
          
         
         <center>89<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Lo, for no noise or light of thunder <br>
         Shall these grave-clothes be rent in sunder; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         He that hath taken, shall he give? <br>
         He hath rent them: shall he bind together? <br>
         He hath bound them: shall he break the tether? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         He hath slain them: shall he bid them live?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         A little sorrow, a little pleasure, <br>
         Fate metes us from the dusty measure <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That holds the date of all of us; <br>
         We are born with travail and strong crying, <br>
         And from the birth-day to the dying <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The likeness of our life is thus.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         One girds himself to serve another, <br>
         Whose father was the dust, whose mother <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The little dead red worm therein; <br>
         They find no fruit of things they cherish; <br>
         The goodness of a man shall perish, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         It shall be one thing with his sin.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In deep wet ways by grey old gardens <br>
         Fed with sharp spring the sweet fruit hardens; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         They know not what fruits wane or grow; <br>
         Red summer burns to the utmost ember; <br>
         They know not, neither can remember, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The old years and flowers they used to know.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah, for their sakes, so trapped and taken, <br>
         For theirs, forgotten and forsaken, <br>
         
         <center>90<br></center>
         
         &nbsp;
         Watch, sleep not, gird thyself with prayer. <br>
         Nay, where the heart of wrath is broken, <br>
         Where long love ends as a thing spoken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         How shall thy crying enter there?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Though the iron sides of the old world falter <br>
         The likeness of them shall not alter <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For all the rumour of periods, <br>
         The stars and seasons that come after, <br>
         The tears of latter men, the laughter <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of the old unalterable gods.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Far up above the years and nations, <br>
         The high gods, clothed and crowned with patience, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Endure through days of deathlike date; <br>
         They bear the witness of things hidden; <br>
         Before their eyes all life stands chidden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As they before the eyes of Fate.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Not for their love shall Fate retire, <br>
         Nor they relent for our desire, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor the graves open for their call. <br>
         The end is more than joy and anguish, <br>
         Than lives that laugh and lives that languish, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The poppied sleep, the end of all. <br>

         A pleasure-house for all the loves his kin; <br>
         But on the one side sat a man like death, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And on the other a woman sat like sin. <br>
         So with veiled eyes and sobs between his breath <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Love turned himself and would not enter in.<br>

         Love, is it love or sleep or shadow or light <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That lies between thine eyelids and thine eyes? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Like a flower laid upon a flower it lies, <br>
         Or like the night's dew laid upon the night. <br>
         Love stands upon thy left hand and thy right, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yet by no sunset and by no moonrise <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall make thee man and ease a woman's sighs, <br>
         Or make thee woman for a man's delight. <br>
         To what strange end hath some strange god made fair <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The double blossom of two fruitless flowers? <br>
         Hid love in all the folds of all thy hair, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fed thee on summers, watered thee with showers, <br>
         Given all the gold that all the seasons wear <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To thee that art a thing of barren hours?<br>

         Yea, love, I see; it is not love but fear. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nay, sweet, it is not fear but love, I know; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or wherefore should thy body's blossom blow <br>
         So sweetly, or thine eyelids leave so clear <br>
         Thy gracious eyes that never made a tear—<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though for their love our tears like blood should
         flow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though love and life and death should come and go, <br>
         So dreadful, so desirable, so dear?<br>
         Yea, sweet, I know; I saw in what swift wise <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Beneath the woman's and the water's kiss <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy moist limbs melted into Salmacis, <br>
         And the large light turned tender in thine eyes, <br>
         And all thy boy's breath softened into sighs; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But Love being blind, how should he know of this?<br>

         Year after year makes flowers;<br>

         And the next year lacks none.<br>

         The old heroes in time fled,<br>

         No dream-divided sleep;<br>
         And holier eyes have wept<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than ours, when on her dead<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Gods have seen Thetis weep,<br>
         With heavenly hair far-swept<br>

         Back, heavenly hands outspread<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;

         Could not one day withhold,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One night; and like as these<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         White ashes of no weight,<br>
         Held not his urn the cold<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ashes of Heracles?<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For all things born one gate<br>
         Opens, no gate of gold;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Opens; and no man sees<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Beyond the gods and fate.<br>

         Clear apple-leaves are soft upon that moon <br>

         Nay take it then, my flower, my first in June, <br>
         My rose, so like a tender mouth it is: <br>

         &nbsp;
         And with the slain of love love's ways are strewn, <br>

         &nbsp;
         Break down thy vine ere yet grape-gatherers prune, <br>
         Slay me ere day can slay desire again; <br>

         White gloss and sheen; <br>
         Carved lips that make my lips a cup <br>

         Wine and rank poison, milk and blood, <br>

         Being mixed therein <br>
         Since first the devil threw dice with God <br>

         For you, Faustine.<br>

         Your naked new-born soul, their stake, <br>

         Long since, I ween, <br>

         Long since, Faustine.<br>

         The die rang sideways as it fell, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Rang cracked and thin, <br>
         Like a man's laughter heard in hell <br>

         Far down, Faustine,<br>

         A shadow of laughter like a sigh, <br>

         Dead sorrow's kin; <br>
         So rang, thrown down, the devil's die <br>

         One hard to wean; <br>

         <br><br>
         You could do all things but be good <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or chaste of mien; <br>
         And that you would not if you could, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We know, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Even he who cast seven devils out <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of Magdalene <br>
         Could hardly do as much, I doubt, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For you, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Did Satan make you to spite God? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or did God mean <br>
         To scourge with scorpions for a rod <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our sins, Faustine?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I know what queen at first you were, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As though I had seen <br>
         Red gold and black imperious hair <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Twice crown Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         As if your fed sarcophagus <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Spared flesh and skin, <br>
         You come back face to face with us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The same Faustine.<br>
         
         
         <center>125<br></center>
         <br><br>
         She loved the games men played with death, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where death must win; <br>
         As though the slain man's blood and breath <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Revived Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Nets caught the pike, pikes tore the net; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lithe limbs and lean <br>
         From drained-out pores dripped thick red sweat <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To soothe Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She drank the steaming drift and dust <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Blown off the scene; <br>
         Blood could not ease the bitter lust <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That galled Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All round the foul fat furrows reeked, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where blood sank in; <br>
         The circus splashed and seethed and shrieked <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All round Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But these are gone now: years entomb <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The dust and din; <br>
         Yea, even the bath's fierce reek and fume <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That slew Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Was life worth living then? and now <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is life worth sin? <br>
         Where are the imperial years? and how <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Are you Faustine?<br>
         
         
         <center>126<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Your soul forgot her joys, forgot <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her times of teen; <br>
         Yea, this life likewise will you not <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Forget, Faustine?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For in the time we know not of <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Did fate begin <br>
         Weaving the web of days that wove <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Your doom, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The threads were wet with wine, and all <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Were smooth to spin; <br>
         They wove you like a Bacchanal, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The first Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And Bacchus cast your mates and you <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wild grapes to glean; <br>
         Your flower-like lips were dashed with dew <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From his, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Your drenched loose hands were stretched to hold <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The vine's wet green, <br>
         Long ere they coined in Roman gold <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Your face, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then after change of soaring feather <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And winnowing fin, <br>
         You woke in weeks of feverish weather, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A new Faustine.<br>
         
         
         <center>127<br></center>
         <br><br>
         A star upon your birthday burned, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Whose fierce serene <br>
         Red pulseless planet never yearned <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In heaven, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Stray breaths of Sapphic song that blew <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Through Mitylene <br>
         Shook the fierce quivering blood in you <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         By night, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The shameless nameless love that makes <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Hell's iron gin <br>
         Shut on you like a trap that breaks <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The soul, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And when your veins were void and dead, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What ghosts unclean <br>
         Swarmed round the straitened barren bed <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That hid Faustine?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         What sterile growths of sexless root <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or epicene? <br>
         What flower of kisses without fruit <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of love, Faustine?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         What adders came to shed their coats? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What coiled obscene <br>
         Small serpents with soft stretching throats <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Caressed Faustine?<br>
         
         
         <center>128<br></center>
         <br><br>
         But the time came of famished hours, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Maimed loves and mean, <br>
         This ghastly thin-faced time of ours, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To spoil Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         You seem a thing that hinges hold, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A love-machine <br>
         With clockwork joints of supple gold— <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No more, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Not godless, for you serve one God, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The Lampsacene, <br>
         Who metes the gardens with his rod; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Your lord, Faustine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         If one should love you with real love <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         (Such things have been, <br>
         Things your fair face knows nothing of, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         It seems, Faustine);<br>
         
         <br><br>
         That clear hair heavily bound back, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The lights wherein <br>
         Shift from dead blue to burnt-up black; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Your throat, Faustine,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Strong, heavy, throwing out the face <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And hard bright chin <br>
         And shameful scornful lips that grace <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Their shame, Faustine,<br>
         
         
         <center>129<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Curled lips, long since half kissed away, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Still sweet and keen; <br>
         You'd give him—poison shall we say? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or what, Faustine? <br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">There</span> was a graven image of Desire <br>

         Painted with red blood on a ground of gold <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Passing between the young men and the old, <br>
         And by him Pain, whose body shone like fire, <br>
         And Pleasure with gaunt hands that grasped their hire. <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Of his left wrist, with fingers clenched and cold, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The insatiable Satiety kept hold, <br>
         Walking with feet unshod that pashed the mire. <br>
         The senses and the sorrows and the sins, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the strange loves that suck the breasts of Hate <br>
         Till lips and teeth bite in their sharp indenture, <br>
         Followed like beasts with flap of wings and fins. <br>

         Death stood aloof behind a gaping grate, <br>

         Upon whose lock was written <i>Peradventure.</i>

         Death parts thee and my love of thee; <br>
         Sweet love, that yet art living man, <br>

         Come back, true love, to comfort me. <br>
         Back, ah, come back! ah wellaway! <br>
         But my love comes not any day.<br>

         As roses, when the warm West blows, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Break to full flower and sweeten spring, <br>
         My soul would break to a glorious rose <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In such wise at his whispering. <br>
         In vain I listen; wellaway! <br>
         My love says nothing any day.<br>

         You that will weep for pity of love <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         On the low place where I am lain, <br>
         I pray you, having wept enough, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Tell him for whom I bore such pain <br>
         That he was yet, ah! wellaway! <br>

         &nbsp;
         Whatever comes with years. <br>
         We twain shall not remeasure <br>

         The ways that left us twain; <br>
         Nor crush the lees of pleasure <br>

         From sanguine grapes of pain.<br>

         What will the mad gods do <br>
         For hate with me, I wonder, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or what for love with you? <br>
         Forget them till November, <br>

         And dream that I forget.<br>

         Time found our tired love sleeping, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And kissed away his breath; <br>
         But what should we do weeping, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though light love sleep to death? <br>
         
         <center>133<br></center>
         We have drained his lips at leisure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till there's not left to drain <br>
         A single sob of pleasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A single pulse of pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Dream that the lips once breathless <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Might quicken if they would; <br>
         Say that the soul is deathless; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Dream that the gods are good; <br>
         Say March may wed September, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And time divorce regret; <br>
         But not that you remember, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And not that I forget.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We have heard from hidden places <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What love scarce lives and hears: <br>
         We have seen on fervent faces <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The pallor of strange tears: <br>
         We have trod the wine-vat's treasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Whence, ripe to steam and stain, <br>
         Foams round the feet of pleasure <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The blood-red must of pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Remembrance may recover <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And time bring back to time <br>
         The name of your first lover, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The ring of my first rhyme; <br>
         But rose-leaves of December <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The frosts of June shall fret, <br>
         
         <center>134<br></center>
         The day that you remember, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The day that I forget.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The snake that hides and hisses <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In heaven we twain have known; <br>
         The grief of cruel kisses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The joy whose mouth makes moan;<br>
         The pulse's pause and measure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where in one furtive vein <br>
         Throbs through the heart of pleasure <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The purpler blood of pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We have done with tears and treasons <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And love for treason's sake; <br>
         Room for the swift new seasons, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The years that burn and break, <br>
         Dismantle and dismember <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Men's days and dreams, Juliette; <br>
         For love may not remember, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But time will not forget.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Life treads down love in flying, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Time withers him at root; <br>
         Bring all dead things and dying, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Reaped sheaf and ruined fruit, <br>
         Where, crushed by three days' pressure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our three days' love lies slain; <br>
         And earlier leaf of pleasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And latter flower of pain.<br>
         
         
         <center>135<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Breathe close upon the ashes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         It may be flame will leap; <br>
         Unclose the soft close lashes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lift up the lids, and weep. <br>
         Light love's extinguished ember, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Let one tear leave it wet <br>
         For one that you remember <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And ten that you forget. <br>

         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">When</span> the game began between them for a jest, <br>
         He played king and she played queen to match the best; <br>
         Laughter soft as tears, and tears that turned to laughter, <br>
         These were things she sought for years and sorrowed after.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Pleasure with dry lips, and pain that walks by night; <br>
         All the sting and all the stain of long delight; <br>
         These were things she knew not of, that knew not of her, <br>
         When she played at half a love with half a lover.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Time was chorus, gave them cues to laugh or cry; <br>
         They would kill, befool, amuse him, let him die; <br>
         Set him webs to weave to-day and break to-morrow, <br>
         Till he died for good in play, and rose in sorrow.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         What the years mean; how time dies and is not slain; <br>
         How love grows and laughs and cries and wanes again; <br>
         These were things she came to know, and take their measure, <br>
         When the play was played out so for one man's pleasure. <br>

         <h3>THE LEPER.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Nothing</span> is better, I well think, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than love; the hidden well-water <br>
         Is not so delicate to drink: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This was well seen of me and her.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I served her in a royal house; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I served her wine and curious meat. <br>
         For will to kiss between her brows <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I had no heart to sleep or eat.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Mere scorn God knows she had of me; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A poor scribe, nowise great or fair, <br>
         Who plucked his clerk's hood back to see <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her curled-up lips and amorous hair.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I vex my head with thinking this. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yea, though God always hated me, <br>
         And hates me now that I can kiss <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her eyes, plait up her hair to see<br>
         
         
         <center>138<br></center>
         <br><br>
         How she then wore it on the brows, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yet am I glad to have her dead <br>
         Here in this wretched wattled house <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where I can kiss her eyes and head.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Nothing is better, I well know, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than love; no amber in cold sea <br>
         Or gathered berries under snow: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That is well seen of her and me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Three thoughts I make my pleasure of: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         First I take heart and think of this: <br>
         That knight's gold hair she chose to love, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         His mouth she had such will to kiss.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then I remember that sundawn <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I brought him by a privy way <br>
         Out at her lattice, and thereon <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What gracious words she found to say.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         (Cold rushes for such little feet— <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Both feet could lie into my hand. <br>
         A marvel was it of my sweet <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her upright body could so stand.)<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "Sweet friend, God give you thank and grace; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Now am I clean and whole of shame, <br>
         Nor shall men burn me in the face <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For my sweet fault that scandals them."<br>
         
         
         <center>139<br></center>
         <br><br>
         I tell you over word by word. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She, sitting edgewise on her bed, <br>
         Holding her feet, said thus. The third, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A sweeter thing than these, I said.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         God, that makes time and ruins it, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And alters not, abiding God, <br>
         Changed with disease her body sweet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The body of love wherein she abode.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Love is more sweet and comelier <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than a dove's throat strained out to sing. <br>
         All they spat out and cursed at her <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And cast her forth for a base thing.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They cursed her, seeing how God had wrought <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This curse to plague her, a curse of his. <br>
         Fools were they surely, seeing not <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         How sweeter than all sweet she is.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         He that had held her by the hair, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With kissing lips blinding her eyes, <br>
         Felt her bright bosom, strained and bare, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sigh under him, with short mad cries<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Out of her throat and sobbing mouth <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And body broken up with love, <br>
         With sweet hot tears his lips were loth <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her own should taste the savour of,<br>
         
         
         <center>140<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Yea, he inside whose grasp all night <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her fervent body leapt or lay, <br>
         Stained with sharp kisses red and white, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Found her a plague to spurn away.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I hid her in this wattled house, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I served her water and poor bread. <br>
         For joy to kiss between her brows <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Time upon time I was nigh dead.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Bread failed; we got but well-water <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And gathered grass with dropping seed. <br>
         I had such joy of kissing her, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I had small care to sleep or feed.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Sometimes when service made me glad <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The sharp tears leapt between my lids, <br>
         Falling on her, such joy I had <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To do the service God forbids.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "I pray you let me be at peace, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Get hence, make room for me to die." <br>
         She said that: her poor lip would cease, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Put up to mine, and turn to cry.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I said, "Bethink yourself how love <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fared in us twain, what either did; <br>
         Shall I unclothe my soul thereof? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That I should do this, God forbid."<br>
         
         
         <center>141<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Yea, though God hateth us, he knows <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That hardly in a little thing <br>
         Love faileth of the work it does <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till it grow ripe for gathering.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Six months, and now my sweet is dead <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A trouble takes me; I know not <br>
         If all were done well, all well said, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No word or tender deed forgot.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Too sweet, for the least part in her, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To have shed life out by fragments; yet, <br>
         Could the close mouth catch breath and stir, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I might see something I forget.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Six months, and I sit still and hold <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In two cold palms her cold two feet. <br>
         Her hair, half grey half ruined gold, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thrills me and burns me in kissing it.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Love bites and stings me through, to see <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her keen face made of sunken bones. <br>
         Her worn-off eyelids madden me, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That were shot through with purple once.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She said, "Be good with me; I grow <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         So tired for shame's sake, I shall die <br>
         If you say nothing:" even so. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And she is dead now, and shame put by.<br>
         
         
         <center>142<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Yea, and the scorn she had of me <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the old time, doubtless vexed her then. <br>
         I never should have kissed her. See <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What fools God's anger makes of men!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She might have loved me a little too, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Had I been humbler for her sake. <br>
         But that new shame could make love new <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She saw not—yet her shame did make.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I took too much upon my love, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Having for such mean service done <br>
         Her beauty and all the ways thereof, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her face and all the sweet thereon.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, all this while I tended her, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I know the old love held fast his part: <br>
         I know the old scorn waxed heavier, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Mixed with sad wonder, in her heart.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         It may be all my love went wrong— <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A scribe's work writ awry and blurred, <br>
         Scrawled after the blind evensong— <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Spoilt music with no perfect word.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But surely I would fain have done <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All things the best I could. Perchance <br>
         Because I failed, came short of one, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She kept at heart that other man's.<br>
         
         
         <center>143<br></center>
         <br><br>
         I am grown blind with all these things: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         It may be now she hath in sight <br>
         Some better knowledge; still there clings <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The old question. Will not God do right? *
         <br>
         
         
         
         
         <br><br>
         
         *
         
         
          En ce temps-là estoyt dans ce pays grand nombre de ladres et de
         meseaulx, ce dont le roy eut grand desplaisir, veu que Dieu dust
         en estre moult griefvement courroucé. Ores il advint qu'une
         noble damoyselle appelée Yolande de Sallières estant atteincte
         et touste guastée de ce vilain mal, tous ses amys et ses parens
         ayant devant leurs yeux la paour de Dieu la firent issir fors de
         leurs maisons et oncques ne voulurent recepvoir ni reconforter
         chose mauldicte de Dieu et à tous les hommes puante et
         abhominable. Ceste dame avoyt esté moult belle et gracieuse de
         formes, et de son corps elle estoyt large et de vie lascive.
         Pourtant nul des amans qui l'avoyent souventesfois accollée et
         baisée moult tendrement ne voulust plus héberger si laide femme
         et si détestable pescheresse. Ung seul clerc qui feut
         premièrement son lacquays et son entremetteur en matière d'amour
         la reçut chez luy et la récéla dans une petite cabane. Là mourut
         la meschinette de grande misère et de male mort: et après elle
         décéda ledist clerc qui pour grand amour l'avoyt six mois durant
         soignée, lavée, habillée et deshabillée tous les jours de ses
         mains propres. Mesme dist-on que ce meschant homme et mauldict
         clerc se remémourant de la grande beauté passée et guastée de
         ceste femme se délectoyt maintesfois à la baiser sur sa bouche
         orde et lépreuse et l'accoller doulcement de ses mains
         amoureuses. Aussy est-il mort de ceste mesme maladie
         abhominable. Cecy advint près Fontainebellant en Gastinois. Et

         <h3>A BALLAD OF BURDENS.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">The</span> burden of fair women. Vain delight,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And love self-slain in some sweet shameful way,<br>
         And sorrowful old age that comes by night<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As a thief comes that has no heart by day,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And change that finds fair cheeks and leaves them
         grey,<br>
         And weariness that keeps awake for hire,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And grief that says what pleasure used to say;<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The burden of bought kisses. This is sore,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A burden without fruit in childbearing;<br>
         Between the nightfall and the dawn threescore,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Threescore between the dawn and evening.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The shuddering in thy lips, the shuddering<br>
         In thy sad eyelids tremulous like fire,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Makes love seem shameful and a wretched thing.<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         
         <center>145<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The burden of sweet speeches. Nay, kneel down,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Cover thy head, and weep; for verily<br>
         These market-men that buy thy white and brown<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the last days shall take no thought for thee.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the last days like earth thy face shall be,<br>
         Yea, like sea-marsh made thick with brine and mire,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sad with sick leavings of the sterile sea.<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The burden of long living. Thou shalt fear<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Waking, and sleeping mourn upon thy bed;<br>
         And say at night "Would God the day were here,"<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And say at dawn "Would God the day were dead."<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With weary days thou shalt be clothed and fed,<br>
         And wear remorse of heart for thine attire,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Pain for thy girdle and sorrow upon thine head;<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The burden of bright colours. Thou shalt see<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Gold tarnished, and the grey above the green;<br>
         And as the thing thou seest thy face shall be,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And no more as the thing beforetime seen.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And thou shalt say of mercy "It hath been,"<br>
         And living, watch the old lips and loves expire,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And talking, tears shall take thy breath between;<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The burden of sad sayings. In that day<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou shalt tell all thy days and hours, and tell<br>
         
         <center>146<br></center>
         Thy times and ways and words of love, and say<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         How one was dear and one desirable,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And sweet was life to hear and sweet to smell,<br>
         But now with lights reverse the old hours retire<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the last hour is shod with fire from hell;<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The burden of fair seasons. Rain in spring,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         White rain and wind among the tender trees;<br>
         A summer of green sorrows gathering,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Rank autumn in a mist of miseries,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With sad face set towards the year, that sees<br>
         The charred ash drop out of the dropping pyre,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And winter wan with many maladies;<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The burden of dead faces. Out of sight<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And out of love, beyond the reach of hands,<br>
         Changed in the changing of the dark and light,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         They walk and weep about the barren lands<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where no seed is nor any garner stands,<br>
         Where in short breaths the doubtful days respire,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And time's turned glass lets through the sighing
         sands;<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The burden of much gladness. Life and lust<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Forsake thee, and the face of thy delight;<br>
         And underfoot the heavy hour strews dust,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And overhead strange weathers burn and bite;<br>
         
         <center>147<br></center>
         
         &nbsp;
         And where the red was, lo the bloodless white,<br>
         And where truth was, the likeness of a liar,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And where day was, the likeness of the night;<br>
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         <h3>L'ENVOY.</h3>
         Princes, and ye whom pleasure quickeneth,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Heed well this rhyme before your pleasure tire;<br>
         For life is sweet, but after life is death.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This is the end of every man's desire.<br>

         Deep as deep flowers and dreamy like dim skies;<br>
         With her own tresses bound and found her fair,<br>

         And though I were not, though I be not, best,<br>
         I have loved and love thee more than all the rest. <br>
         O love, O lover, loose or hold me fast,<br>

         Fairer or not, what need I know, what care?<br>
         To thy fair bud my blossom once seemed fair.<br>
         Why am I fair at all before thee, why<br>
         At all desired? seeing thou art fair, not I.<br>

         Alive, alone, without thee, with thee, dead;<br>

         To many another brow and balmier breast,<br>
         And sweeter arms, or sweeter to thy mind,<br>
          Lull thee or lure, more fond thou wilt not find.<br>

         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As once this year:<br>
         
         
         <center>156<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Shall never smile and turn and rest<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         On mine as there,<br>
         Nor one most sacred hand be prest<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Upon my hair.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I came as one whose thoughts half linger,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Half run before;<br>
         The youngest to the oldest singer<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That England bore.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I found him whom I shall not find<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Till all grief end,<br>
         In holiest age our mightiest mind,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Father and friend.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But thou, if anything endure,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         If hope there be,<br>
         O spirit that man's life left pure,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Man's death set free,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Not with disdain of days that were<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Look earthward now;<br>
         Let dreams revive the reverend hair,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The imperial brow;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Come back in sleep, for in the life<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Where thou art not<br>
         We find none like thee. Time and strife<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the world's lot<br>
         
         
         <center>157<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Move thee no more; but love at least<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And reverent heart<br>
         May move thee, royal and released,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Soul, as thou art.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And thou, his Florence, to thy trust<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Receive and keep,<br>
         Keep safe his dedicated dust,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         His sacred sleep.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         So shall thy lovers, come from far,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Mix with thy name<br>
         As morning-star with evening-star<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         His faultless fame.<br>

         <h3>A SONG IN TIME OF ORDER. 1852.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Push</span> hard across the sand, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For the salt wind gathers breath; <br>
         Shoulder and wrist and hand, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Push hard as the push of death.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The wind is as iron that rings, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The foam-heads loosen and flee; <br>
         It swells and welters and swings, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The pulse of the tide of the sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And up on the yellow cliff <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The long corn flickers and shakes; <br>
         Push, for the wind holds stiff, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the gunwale dips and rakes.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Good hap to the fresh fierce weather, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The quiver and beat of the sea! <br>
         While three men hold together, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The kingdoms are less by three.<br>
         
         
         <center>159<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Out to the sea with her there, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Out with her over the sand; <br>
         Let the kings keep the earth for their share! <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         We have done with the sharers of land.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They have tied the world in a tether, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         They have bought over God with a fee; <br>
         While three men hold together, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The kingdoms are less by three.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We have done with the kisses that sting, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The thief's mouth red from the feast, <br>
         The blood on the hands of the king <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the lie at the lips of the priest.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Will they tie the winds in a tether, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Put a bit in the jaws of the sea? <br>
         While three men hold together, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The kingdoms are less by three.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let our flag run out straight in the wind! <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The old red shall be floated again <br>
         When the ranks that are thin shall be thinned, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         When the names that were twenty are ten;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         When the devil's riddle is mastered <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the galley-bench creaks with a Pope, <br>
         We shall see Buonaparte the bastard <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Kick heels with his throat in a rope.<br>
         
         
         <center>160<br></center>
         <br><br>
         While the shepherd sets wolves on his sheep <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the emperor halters his kine, <br>
         While Shame is a watchman asleep <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And Faith is a keeper of swine,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let the wind shake our flag like a feather, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Like the plumes of the foam of the sea! <br>
         While three men hold together, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The kingdoms are less by three.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All the world has its burdens to bear, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         From Cayenne to the Austrian whips; <br>
         Forth, with the rain in our hair <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the salt sweet foam in our lips;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In the teeth of the hard glad weather, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         In the blown wet face of the sea; <br>
         While three men hold together, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The kingdoms are less by three. <br>

         <h3>A SONG IN TIME OF REVOLUTION. 1860.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">The</span> heart of the rulers is sick, and the high-priest covers
         his head: <br>
         For this is the song of the quick that is heard in the ears of the
         dead.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The poor and the halt and the blind are keen and mighty and fleet: <br>
         Like the noise of the blowing of wind is the sound of the noise of
         their feet.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The wind has the sound of a laugh in the clamour of days and of
         deeds: <br>
         The priests are scattered like chaff, and the rulers broken like
         reeds.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The high-priest sick from qualms, with his raiment bloodily
         dashed; <br>
         The thief with branded palms, and the liar with cheeks
         abashed.<br>
         
         
         <center>162<br></center>
         <br><br>
         They are smitten, they tremble greatly, they are pained for their
         pleasant things; <br>
         For the house of the priests made stately, and the might in the
         mouth of the kings.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They are grieved and greatly afraid; they are taken, they shall
         not flee: <br>
         For the heart of the nations is made as the strength of the
         springs of the sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They were fair in the grace of gold, they walked with delicate
         feet: <br>
         They were clothed with the cunning of old, and the smell of their
         garments was sweet.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For the breaking of gold in their hair they halt as a man made
         lame: <br>
         They are utterly naked and bare; their mouths are bitter with
         shame.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Wilt thou judge thy people now, O king that wast found most wise? <br>
         Wilt thou lie any more, O thou whose mouth is emptied of
         lies?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Shall God make a pact with thee, till his hook be found in thy
         sides? <br>
         Wilt thou put back the time of the sea, or the place of the
         season of tides?<br>
         
         
         <center>163<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Set a word in thy lips, to stand before God with a word in thy
         mouth; <br>
         That "the rain shall return in the land, and the tender dew after
         drouth."<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But the arm of the elders is broken, their strength is unbound
         and undone: <br>
         They wait for a sign of a token; they cry, and there cometh
         none.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Their moan is in every place, the cry of them filleth the land: <br>
         There is shame in the sight of their face, there is fear in the
         thews of their hand.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They are girdled about the reins with a curse for the girdle
         thereon: <br>
         For the noise of the rending of chains the face of their colour
         is gone.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For the sound of the shouting of men they are grievously stricken
         at heart: <br>
         They are smitten asunder with pain, their bones are smitten
         apart.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There is none of them all that is whole; their lips gape open for
         breath; <br>
         They are clothed with sickness of soul, and the shape of the
         shadow of death.<br>
         
         <center>164<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The wind is thwart in their feet; it is full of the shouting of
         mirth; <br>
         As one shaketh the sides of a sheet, so it shaketh the ends of
         the earth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The sword, the sword is made keen; the iron has opened its mouth; <br>
         The corn is red that was green; it is bound for the sheaves of
         the south.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The sound of a word was shed, the sound of the wind as a breath, <br>
         In the ears of the souls that were dead, in the dust of the
         deepness of death;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Where the face of the moon is taken, the ways of the stars
         undone, <br>
         The light of the whole sky shaken, the light of the face of the
         sun:<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Where the waters are emptied and broken, the waves of the waters
         are stayed; <br>
         Where God has bound for a token the darkness that maketh
         afraid;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Where the sword was covered and hidden, and dust had grown in its
         side, <br>
         A word came forth which was bidden, the crying of one that
         cried:<br>
         
         <center>165<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The sides of the two-edged sword shall be bare, and its mouth
         shall be red, <br>
         For the breath of the face of the Lord that is felt in the bones
         of the dead. <br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">In</span> the fair days when God <br>

         By man as godlike trod, <br>
         And each alike was Greek, alike was free, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         God's lightning spared, they said, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Alone the happier head <br>
         Whose laurels screened it; fruitless grace for thee, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To whom the high gods gave of right <br>
         Their thunders and their laurels and their light.<br>
         
         <br><br>

         Sunbeams and bays before <br>

         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But far from these ere now <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And watched with jealous brow <br>
         Lay the blind lightnings shut between God's hands, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And only loosed on slaves and kings <br>
         The terror of the tempest of their wings.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Born in those younger years <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That shone with storms of spears <br>
         
         <center>167<br></center>
         And shook in the wind blown from a dead world's pyre, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         When by her back-blown hair <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Napoleon caught the fair <br>
         And fierce Republic with her feet of fire,<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And stayed with iron words and hands <br>
         Her flight, and freedom in a thousand lands:<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thou sawest the tides of things <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Close over heads of kings, <br>
         And thine hand felt the thunder, and to thee <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Laurels and lightnings were <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As sunbeams and soft air <br>
         Mixed each in other, or as mist with sea <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Mixed, or as memory with desire, <br>
         Or the lute's pulses with the louder lyre.<br>
         
         <br><br>

         Disrobed of flesh and blood, <br>
         And bare the heart of the most secret hours; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And to thine hand more tame <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Than birds in winter came <br>
         High hopes and unknown flying forms of powers, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And from thy table fed, and sang <br>
         Till with the tune men's ears took fire and rang.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Even all men's eyes and ears <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With fiery sound and tears <br>
         Waxed hot, and cheeks caught flame and eyelids light, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         At those high songs of thine <br>
         
         <center>168<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That stung the sense like wine, <br>
         Or fell more soft than dew or snow by night, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Or wailed as in some flooded cave <br>
         Sobs the strong broken spirit of a wave.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But we, our master, we <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whose hearts, uplift to thee,<br>
         Ache with the pulse of thy remembered song, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         We ask not nor await <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         From the clenched hands of fate, <br>
         As thou, remission of the world's old wrong; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Respite we ask not, nor release; <br>
         Freedom a man may have, he shall not peace.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Though thy most fiery hope <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Storm heaven, to set wide ope <br>
         The all-sought-for gate whence God or Chance debars <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         All feet of men, all eyes— <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The old night resumes her skies, <br>
         Her hollow hiding-place of clouds and stars, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Where nought save these is sure in sight; <br>
         And, paven with death, our days are roofed with night.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         One thing we can; to be <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Awhile, as men may, free; <br>
         But not by hope or pleasure the most stern <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Goddess, most awful-eyed, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Sits, but on either side <br>
         Sit sorrow and the wrath of hearts that burn, <br>
         
         <center>169<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Sad faith that cannot hope or fear, <br>
         And memory grey with many a flowerless year.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Not that in stranger's wise <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         I lift not loving eyes <br>
         To the fair foster-mother France, that gave <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Beyond the pale fleet foam <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Help to my sires and home, <br>
         Whose great sweet breast could shelter those and save<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whom from her nursing breasts and hands <br>
         Their land cast forth of old on gentler lands.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Not without thoughts that ache <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For theirs and for thy sake, <br>
         I, born of exiles, hail thy banished head; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         I whose young song took flight <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Toward the great heat and light <br>
         On me a child from thy far splendour shed, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         From thine high place of soul and song, <br>
         Which, fallen on eyes yet feeble, made them strong.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Ah, not with lessening love <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For memories born hereof, <br>
         I look to that sweet mother-land, and see <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The old fields and fair full streams, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And skies, but fled like dreams <br>
         The feet of freedom and the thought of thee; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And all between the skies and graves <br>
         The mirth of mockers and the shame of slaves.<br>
         
         
         <center>170<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         She, killed with noisome air, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Even she! and still so fair, <br>
         Who said "Let there be freedom," and there was <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Freedom; and as a lance <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The fiery eyes of France <br>
         Touched the world's sleep and as a sleep made pass <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Forth of men's heavier ears and eyes <br>
         Smitten with fire and thunder from new skies.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Are they men's friends indeed <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Who watch them weep and bleed? <br>
         Because thou hast loved us, shall the gods love thee?<br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thou, first of men and friend, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Seest thou, even thou, the end? <br>
         Thou knowest what hath been, knowest thou what shall be? <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Evils may pass and hopes endure; <br>
         But fate is dim, and all the gods obscure.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         O nursed in airs apart, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         O poet highest of heart, <br>
         Hast thou seen time, who hast seen so many things? <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Are not the years more wise, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         More sad than keenest eyes, <br>
         The years with soundless feet and sounding wings? <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Passing we hear them not, but past <br>
         The clamour of them thrills us, and their blast.<br>
         
         <center>171<br></center>
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thou art chief of us, and lord; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thy song is as a sword <br>
         Keen-edged and scented in the blade from flowers; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thou art lord and king; but we <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Lift younger eyes, and see <br>
         Less of high hope, less light on wandering hours; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Hours that have borne men down so long, <br>
         Seen the right fail, and watched uplift the wrong.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But thine imperial soul, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As years and ruins roll <br>
         To the same end, and all things and all dreams <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With the same wreck and roar <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Drift on the dim same shore, <br>
         Still in the bitter foam and brackish streams <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Tracks the fresh water-spring to be <br>
         And sudden sweeter fountains in the sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As once the high God bound <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With many a rivet round <br>
         Man's saviour, and with iron nailed him through, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         At the wild end of things, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Where even his own bird's wings <br>
         Flagged, whence the sea shone like a drop of dew, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         From Caucasus beheld below <br>
         Past fathoms of unfathomable snow;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         So the strong God, the chance <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Central of circumstance, <br>
         
         <center>172<br></center>
         Still shows him exile who will not be slave; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         All thy great fame and thee <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Girt by the dim strait sea <br>
         With multitudinous walls of wandering wave; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Shows us our greatest from his throne <br>
         Fate-stricken, and rejected of his own.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Yea, he is strong, thou say'st, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         A mystery many-faced, <br>
         The wild beasts know him and the wild birds flee; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The blind night sees him, death <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Shrinks beaten at his breath, <br>
         And his right hand is heavy on the sea: <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         We know he hath made us, and is king; <br>
         We know not if he care for anything.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thus much, no more, we know; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         He bade what is be so, <br>
         Bade light be and bade night be, one by one; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Bade hope and fear, bade ill <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And good redeem and kill, <br>
         Till all men be aweary of the sun <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And his world burn in its own flame <br>
         And bear no witness longer of his name.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Yet though all this be thus, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Be those men praised of us <br>
         Who have loved and wrought and sorrowed and not sinned <br>
         
         <center>173<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For fame or fear or gold, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Nor waxed for winter cold, <br>
         Nor changed for changes of the worldly wind; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Praised above men of men be these, <br>
         Till this one world and work we know shall cease.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Yea, one thing more than this, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         We know that one thing is, <br>
         The splendour of a spirit without blame, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That not the labouring years <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Blind-born, nor any fears, <br>
         Nor men nor any gods can tire or tame; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But purer power with fiery breath <br>
         Fills, and exalts above the gulfs of death.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Praised above men be thou, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whose laurel-laden brow, <br>
         Made for the morning, droops not in the night; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Praised and beloved, that none <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Of all thy great things done <br>
         Flies higher than thy most equal spirit's flight; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Praised, that nor doubt nor hope could bend <br>
         Earth's loftiest head, found upright to the end. <br>

         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Sweet</span> life, if life were stronger, <br>
         Earth clear of years that wrong her, <br>
         Then two things might live longer, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Two sweeter things than they; <br>
         Delight, the rootless flower, <br>
         And love, the bloomless bower; <br>
         Delight that lives an hour, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And love that lives a day.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         From evensong to daytime, <br>
         When April melts in Maytime, <br>
         Love lengthens out his playtime, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Love lessens breath by breath, <br>
         And kiss by kiss grows older <br>
         On listless throat or shoulder <br>
         Turned sideways now, turned colder <br>

         Life gave, and seemed worth living; <br>

         Sin sweet beyond forgiving <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And brief beyond regret: <br>
         To laugh and love together <br>
         And weave with foam and feather <br>
         And wind and words the tether <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our memories play with yet.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah, one thing worth beginning, <br>
         One thread in life worth spinning, <br>
         Ah sweet, one sin worth sinning <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With all the whole soul's will; <br>
         To lull you till one stilled you, <br>

         Between the bud and blossom, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Between your throat and chin; <br>
         To say of shame—what is it? <br>
         Of virtue—we can miss it; <br>
         Of sin—we can but kiss it, <br>

         Beneath swift sighs that thicken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;

         Paused near us unaffrighted, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who found and left him free; <br>
         None, seeing us cloven in sunder, <br>
         Will weep or laugh or wonder; <br>
         Light love stands clear of thunder, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And safe from winds at sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         As, when late larks give warning <br>
         Of dying lights and dawning, <br>
         Night murmurs to the morning, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         "Lie still, O love, lie still;" <br>
         And half her dark limbs cover <br>
         The white limbs of her lover, <br>
         With amorous plumes that hover <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And fervent lips that chill;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         As scornful day represses <br>
         Night's void and vain caresses, <br>
         And from her cloudier tresses <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Unwinds the gold of his, <br>
         With limbs from limbs dividing <br>
         And breath by breath subsiding; <br>
         
         <center>177<br></center>
         For love has no abiding, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But dies before the kiss;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         So hath it been, so be it; <br>
         For who shall live and flee it? <br>
         But look that no man see it <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or hear it unaware; <br>
         Lest all who love and choose him <br>
         See Love, and so refuse him; <br>
         For all who find him lose him, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But all have found him fair. <br>

         <h3>DOLORES</h3>
         
         <h3>(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS.)</h3>
         <br><br>
         Cold eyelids that hide like a jewel <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Hard eyes that grow soft for an hour; <br>
         The heavy white limbs, and the cruel <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Red mouth like a venomous flower; <br>
         When these are gone by with their glories, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What shall rest of thee then, what remain, <br>
         O mystic and sombre Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Seven sorrows the priests give their Virgin; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But thy sins, which are seventy times seven, <br>
         Seven ages would fail thee to purge in, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And then they would haunt thee in heaven: <br>
         Fierce midnights and famishing morrows, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the loves that complete and control <br>
         All the joys of the flesh, all the sorrows <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That wear out the soul.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O garment not golden but gilded, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O garden where all men may dwell, <br>
         
         <center>179<br></center>
         O tower not of ivory, but builded <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         By hands that reach heaven from hell;<br>
         O mystical rose of the mire, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O house not of gold but of gain, <br>
         O house of unquenchable fire, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O lips full of lust and of laughter, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Curled snakes that are fed from my breast, <br>
         Bite hard, lest remembrance come after <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And press with new lips where you pressed. <br>
         For my heart too springs up at the pressure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Mine eyelids too moisten and burn; <br>
         Ah, feed me and fill me with pleasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ere pain come in turn.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In yesterday's reach and to-morrow's, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Out of sight though they lie of to-day, <br>
         There have been and there yet shall be sorrows <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That smite not and bite not in play. <br>
         The life and the love thou despisest, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         These hurt us indeed, and in vain, <br>
         O wise among women, and wisest, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Who gave thee thy wisdom? what stories <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That stung thee, what visions that smote? <br>
         Wert thou pure and a maiden, Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When desire took thee first by the throat? <br>
         
         <center>180<br></center>
         What bud was the shell of a blossom <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That all men may smell to and pluck? <br>
         What milk fed thee first at what bosom? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What sins gave thee suck?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We shift and bedeck and bedrape us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou art noble and nude and antique;<br>
         Libitina thy mother, Priapus <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy father, a Tuscan and Greek. <br>
         We play with light loves in the portal, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And wince and relent and refrain; <br>
         Loves die, and we know thee immortal, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Fruits fail and love dies and time ranges; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou art fed with perpetual breath, <br>
         And alive after infinite changes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And fresh from the kisses of death; <br>
         Of languors rekindled and rallied, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of barren delights and unclean, <br>
         Things monstrous and fruitless, a pallid <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And poisonous queen.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Could you hurt me, sweet lips, though I hurt you? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Men touch them, and change in a trice <br>
         The lilies and languors of virtue <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For the raptures and roses of vice; <br>
         Those lie where thy foot on the floor is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         These crown and caress thee and chain, <br>
         
         <center>181<br></center>
         O splendid and sterile Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There are sins it may be to discover, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There are deeds it may be to delight. <br>
         What new work wilt thou find for thy lover, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What new passions for daytime or night? <br>
         What spells that they know not a word of <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Whose lives are as leaves overblown? <br>
         What tortures undreamt of, unheard of, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Unwritten, unknown?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah beautiful passionate body <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That never has ached with a heart! <br>
         On thy mouth though the kisses are bloody, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though they sting till it shudder and smart, <br>
         More kind than the love we adore is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         They hurt not the heart or the brain, <br>
         O bitter and tender Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         As our kisses relax and redouble, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From the lips and the foam and the fangs <br>
         Shall no new sin be born for men's trouble, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No dream of impossible pangs? <br>
         With the sweet of the sins of old ages <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wilt thou satiate thy soul as of yore? <br>
         Too sweet is the rind, say the sages, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Too bitter the core.<br>
         
         <center>182<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Hast thou told all thy secrets the last time, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And bared all thy beauties to one? <br>
         Ah, where shall we go then for pastime, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If the worst that can be has been done? <br>
         But sweet as the rind was the core is; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We are fain of thee still, we are fain, <br>
         O sanguine and subtle Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         By the hunger of change and emotion, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         By the thirst of unbearable things, <br>
         By despair, the twin-born of devotion, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         By the pleasure that winces and stings, <br>
         The delight that consumes the desire, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The desire that outruns the delight, <br>
         By the cruelty deaf as a fire <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And blind as the night,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         By the ravenous teeth that have smitten <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Through the kisses that blossom and bud, <br>
         By the lips intertwisted and bitten <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till the foam has a savour of blood, <br>
         By the pulse as it rises and falters, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         By the hands as they slacken and strain, <br>
         I adjure thee, respond from thine altars, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Wilt thou smile as a woman disdaining <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The light fire in the veins of a boy? <br>
         
         <center>183<br></center>
         But he comes to thee sad, without feigning, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who has wearied of sorrow and joy; <br>
         Less careful of labour and glory <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than the elders whose hair has uncurled; <br>
         And young, but with fancies as hoary <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And grey as the world.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I have passed from the outermost portal <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To the shrine where a sin is a prayer; <br>
         What care though the service be mortal? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O our Lady of Torture, what care? <br>
         All thine the last wine that I pour is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The last in the chalice we drain, <br>
         O fierce and luxurious Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All thine the new wine of desire, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The fruit of four lips as they clung <br>
         Till the hair and the eyelids took fire, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The foam of a serpentine tongue, <br>
         The froth of the serpents of pleasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         More salt than the foam of the sea, <br>
         Now felt as a flame, now at leisure <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As wine shed for me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah thy people, thy children, thy chosen, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Marked cross from the womb and perverse! <br>
         They have found out the secret to cozen <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The gods that constrain us and curse; <br>
         
         <center>184<br></center>
         They alone, they are wise, and none other; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Give me place, even me, in their train, <br>
         O my sister, my spouse, and my mother, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For the crown of our life as it closes <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is darkness, the fruit thereof dust; <br>
         No thorns go as deep as a rose's, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And love is more cruel than lust. <br>
         Time turns the old days to derision, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our loves into corpses or wives; <br>
         And marriage and death and division <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Make barren our lives.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And pale from the past we draw nigh thee, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And satiate with comfortless hours; <br>
         And we know thee, how all men belie thee, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And we gather the fruit of thy flowers; <br>
         The passion that slays and recovers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The pangs and the kisses that rain <br>
         On the lips and the limbs of thy lovers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The desire of thy furious embraces <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is more than the wisdom of years, <br>
         On the blossom though blood lie in traces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though the foliage be sodden with tears. <br>
         For the lords in whose keeping the door is <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That opens on all who draw breath <br>
         
         <center>185<br></center>
         Gave the cypress to love, my Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The myrtle to death.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And they laughed, changing hands in the measure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And they mixed and made peace after strife; <br>
         Pain melted in tears, and was pleasure; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Death tingled with blood, and was life. <br>
         Like lovers they melted and tingled, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the dusk of thine innermost fane; <br>
         In the darkness they murmured and mingled, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In a twilight where virtues are vices, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In thy chapels, unknown of the sun, <br>
         To a tune that enthralls and entices, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         They were wed, and the twain were as one. <br>
         For the tune from thine altar hath sounded <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Since God bade the world's work begin, <br>
         And the fume of thine incense abounded, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To sweeten the sin.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Love listens, and paler than ashes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Through his curls as the crown on them slips, <br>
         Lifts languid wet eyelids and lashes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And laughs with insatiable lips. <br>
         Thou shalt hush him with heavy caresses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With music that scares the profane; <br>
         Thou shalt darken his eyes with thy tresses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <center>186<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Thou shalt blind his bright eyes though he wrestle, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou shalt chain his light limbs though he strive; <br>
         In his lips all thy serpents shall nestle, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In his hands all thy cruelties thrive. <br>
         In the daytime thy voice shall go through him, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In his dreams he shall feel thee and ache; <br>
         Thou shalt kindle by night and subdue him <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Asleep and awake.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Thou shalt touch and make redder his roses <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With juice not of fruit nor of bud; <br>
         When the sense in the spirit reposes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou shalt quicken the soul through the blood. <br>
         Thine, thine the one grace we implore is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who would live and not languish or feign, <br>
         O sleepless and deadly Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Dost thou dream, in a respite of slumber, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In a lull of the fires of thy life, <br>
         Of the days without name, without number, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When thy will stung the world into strife; <br>
         When, a goddess, the pulse of thy passion <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Smote kings as they revelled in Rome; <br>
         And they hailed thee re-risen, O Thalassian, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Foam-white, from the foam?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         When thy lips had such lovers to flatter; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When the city lay red from thy rods, <br>
         
         <center>187<br></center>
         And thine hands were as arrows to scatter <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The children of change and their gods; <br>
         When the blood of thy foemen made fervent <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A sand never moist from the main, <br>
         As one smote them, their lord and thy servant, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         On sands by the storm never shaken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor wet from the washing of tides; <br>
         Nor by foam of the waves overtaken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor winds that the thunder bestrides; <br>
         But red from the print of thy paces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Made smooth for the world and its lords, <br>
         Ringed round with a flame of fair faces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And splendid with swords.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There the gladiator, pale for thy pleasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Drew bitter and perilous breath; <br>
         There torments laid hold on the treasure <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of limbs too delicious for death; <br>
         When thy gardens were lit with live torches; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When the world was a steed for thy rein; <br>
         When the nations lay prone in thy porches, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         When, with flame all around him aspirant, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Stood flushed, as a harp-player stands, <br>
         The implacable beautiful tyrant, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Rose-crowned, having death in his hands; <br>
         
         <center>187<br></center>
         And a sound as the sound of loud water <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Smote far through the flight of the fires, <br>
         And mixed with the lightning of slaughter <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A thunder of lyres.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Dost thou dream of what was and no more is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The old kingdoms of earth and the kings? <br>
         Dost thou hunger for these things, Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For these, in a world of new things? <br>
         But thy bosom no fasts could emaciate, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No hunger compel to complain <br>
         Those lips that no bloodshed could satiate, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         As of old when the world's heart was lighter, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Through thy garments the grace of thee glows, <br>
         The white wealth of thy body made whiter <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         By the blushes of amorous blows, <br>
         And seamed with sharp lips and fierce fingers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And branded by kisses that bruise; <br>
         When all shall be gone that now lingers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ah, what shall we lose?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Thou wert fair in the fearless old fashion, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And thy limbs are as melodies yet, <br>
         And move to the music of passion <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With lithe and lascivious regret. <br>
         What ailed us, O gods, to desert you <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For creeds that refuse and restrain? <br>
         
         <center>189<br></center>
         Come down and redeem us from virtue, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All shrines that were Vestal are flameless, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But the flame has not fallen from this; <br>
         Though obscure be the god, and though nameless <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The eyes and the hair that we kiss; <br>
         Low fires that love sits by and forges <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fresh heads for his arrows and thine; <br>
         Hair loosened and soiled in mid orgies <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With kisses and wine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Thy skin changes country and colour, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And shrivels or swells to a snake's. <br>
         Let it brighten and bloat and grow duller, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We know it, the flames and the flakes, <br>
         Red brands on it smitten and bitten, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Round skies where a star is a stain, <br>
         And the leaves with thy litanies written, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         On thy bosom though many a kiss be, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There are none such as knew it of old. <br>
         Was it Alciphron once or Arisbe, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Male ringlets or feminine gold, <br>
         That thy lips met with under the statue, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Whence a look shot out sharp after thieves <br>
         From the eyes of the garden-god at you <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Across the fig-leaves?<br>
         
         
         <center>190<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Then still, through dry seasons and moister, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One god had a wreath to his shrine; <br>
         Then love was the pearl of his oyster, *
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And Venus rose red out of wine. <br>
         We have all done amiss, choosing rather <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Such loves as the wise gods disdain; <br>
         Intercede for us thou with thy father, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In spring he had crowns of his garden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Red corn in the heat of the year, <br>
         Then hoary green olives that harden <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When the grape-blossom freezes with fear; <br>
         And milk-budded myrtles with Venus <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And vine-leaves with Bacchus he trod; <br>
         And ye said, “We have seen, he hath seen us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A visible God.”<br>
         
         <br><br>
         What broke off the garlands that girt you? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What sundered you spirit and clay? <br>
         Weak sins yet alive are as virtue <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To the strength of the sins of that day. <br>
         For dried is the blood of thy lover, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ipsithilla, contracted the vein; <br>
         Cry aloud, “Will he rise and recover, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain?”<br>
         
         <center>191<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Cry aloud; for the old world is broken: <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Cry out; for the Phrygian is priest, <br>
         And rears not the bountiful token <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And spreads not the fatherly feast.<br>
         From the midmost of Ida, from shady <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Recesses that murmur at morn, <br>
         They have brought and baptized her, Our Lady, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A goddess new-born.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And the chaplets of old are above us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the oyster-bed teems out of reach; <br>
         Old poets outsing and outlove us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And Catullus makes mouths at our speech. <br>
         Who shall kiss, in thy father's own city, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With such lips as he sang with, again? <br>
         Intercede for us all of thy pity, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Out of Dindymus heavily laden <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her lions draw bound and unfed <br>
         A mother, a mortal, a maiden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A queen over death and the dead. <br>
         She is cold, and her habit is lowly, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her temple of branches and sods; <br>
         Most fruitful and virginal, holy, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A mother of gods.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She hath wasted with fire thine high places, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She hath hidden and marred and made sad <br>
         
         <center>192<br></center>
         The fair limbs of the Loves, the fair faces <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of gods that were goodly and glad. <br>
         She slays, and her hands are not bloody; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She moves as a moon in the wane, <br>
         White-robed, and thy raiment is ruddy, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They shall pass and their places be taken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The gods and the priests that are pure.<br>
         They shall pass, and shalt thou not be shaken? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         They shall perish, and shalt thou endure? <br>
         Death laughs, breathing close and relentless <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the nostrils and eyelids of lust, <br>
         With a pinch in his fingers of scentless <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And delicate dust.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But the worm shall revive thee with kisses; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou shalt change and transmute as a god, <br>
         As the rod to a serpent that hisses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As the serpent again to a rod. <br>
         Thy life shall not cease though thou doff it; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou shalt live until evil be slain, <br>
         And good shall die first, said thy prophet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Did he lie? did he laugh? does he know it, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Now he lies out of reach, out of breath, <br>
         Thy prophet, thy preacher, thy poet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sin's child by incestuous Death? <br>
         
         <center>193<br></center>
         Did he find out in fire at his waking, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or discern as his eyelids lost light, <br>
         When the bands of the body were breaking <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And all came in sight?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Who has known all the evil before us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or the tyrannous secrets of time? <br>
         Though we match not the dead men that bore us <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         At a song, at a kiss, at a crime— <br>
         Though the heathen outface and outlive us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And our lives and our longings are twain— <br>
         Ah, forgive us our virtues, forgive us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Who are we that embalm and embrace thee <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With spices and savours of song? <br>
         What is time, that his children should face thee? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What am I, that my lips do thee wrong? <br>
         I could hurt thee—but pain would delight thee; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or caress thee—but love would repel; <br>
         And the lovers whose lips would excite thee <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Are serpents in hell.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Who now shall content thee as they did, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy lovers, when temples were built <br>
         And the hair of the sacrifice braided <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the blood of the sacrifice spilt, <br>
         In Lampsacus fervent with faces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In Aphaca red from thy reign, <br>
         
         <center>194<br></center>
         Who embraced thee with awful embraces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Where are they, Cotytto or Venus, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Astarte or Ashtaroth, where? <br>
         Do their hands as we touch come between us? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is the breath of them hot in thy hair? <br>
         From their lips have thy lips taken fever, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With the blood of their bodies grown red? <br>
         Hast thou left upon earth a believer <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If these men are dead?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They were purple of raiment and golden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Filled full of thee, fiery with wine, <br>
         Thy lovers, in haunts unbeholden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In marvellous chambers of thine. <br>
         They are fled, and their footprints escape us, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who appraise thee, adore, and abstain, <br>
         O daughter of Death and Priapus, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         What ails us to fear overmeasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To praise thee with timorous breath, <br>
         O mistress and mother of pleasure, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The one thing as certain as death? <br>
         We shall change as the things that we cherish, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall fade as they faded before, <br>
         As foam upon water shall perish, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As sand upon shore.<br>
         
         <center>195<br></center>
         <br><br>
         We shall know what the darkness discovers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If the grave-pit be shallow or deep; <br>
         And our fathers of old, and our lovers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We shall know if they sleep not or sleep. <br>
         We shall see whether hell be not heaven, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Find out whether tares be not grain, <br>
         And the joys of thee seventy times seven, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Our Lady of Pain. <br>

         <h3>THE GARDEN OF PROSERPINE.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Here</span>, where the world is quiet; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Here, where all trouble seems <br>
         Dead winds' and spent waves' riot <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In doubtful dreams of dreams; <br>
         I watch the green field growing <br>
         For reaping folk and sowing, <br>
         For harvest-time and mowing, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A sleepy world of streams.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I am tired of tears and laughter, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And men that laugh and weep; <br>
         Of what may come hereafter <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For men that sow to reap: <br>
         I am weary of days and hours, <br>
         Blown buds of barren flowers, <br>
         Desires and dreams and powers <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And everything but sleep.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Here life has death for neighbour, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And far from eye or ear <br>
         
         <center>197<br></center>
         Wan waves and wet winds labour, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Weak ships and spirits steer; <br>
         They drive adrift, and whither <br>
         They wot not who make thither; <br>
         But no such winds blow hither, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And no such things grow here.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         No growth of moor or coppice, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No heather-flower or vine, <br>
         But bloomless buds of poppies, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Green grapes of Proserpine, <br>
         Pale beds of blowing rushes <br>
         Where no leaf blooms or blushes <br>
         Save this whereout she crushes <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For dead men deadly wine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Pale, without name or number, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In fruitless fields of corn, <br>
         They bow themselves and slumber <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All night till light is born; <br>
         And like a soul belated, <br>
         In hell and heaven unmated, <br>
         By cloud and mist abated <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Comes out of darkness morn.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Though one were strong as seven, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         He too with death shall dwell, <br>
         Nor wake with wings in heaven, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor weep for pains in hell; <br>
         
         <center>198<br></center>
         Though one were fair as roses, <br>
         His beauty clouds and closes; <br>
         And well though love reposes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the end it is not well.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Pale, beyond porch and portal, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Crowned with calm leaves, she stands <br>
         Who gathers all things mortal <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With cold immortal hands; <br>
         Her languid lips are sweeter <br>
         Than love's who fears to greet her <br>
         To men that mix and meet her <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From many times and lands.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She waits for each and other, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She waits for all men born; <br>
         Forgets the earth her mother, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The life of fruits and corn; <br>
         And spring and seed and swallow <br>
         Take wing for her and follow <br>
         Where summer song rings hollow <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And flowers are put to scorn.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There go the loves that wither, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The old loves with wearier wings; <br>
         And all dead years draw thither, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And all disastrous things; <br>
         Dead dreams of days forsaken, <br>
         Blind buds that snows have shaken, <br>
         
         <center>199<br></center>
         Wild leaves that winds have taken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Red strays of ruined springs.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We are not sure of sorrow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And joy was never sure; <br>
         To-day will die to-morrow; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Time stoops to no man's lure; <br>
         And love, grown faint and fretful, <br>
         With lips but half regretful <br>
         Sighs, and with eyes forgetful <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Weeps that no loves endure.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         From too much love of living, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From hope and fear set free, <br>
         We thank with brief thanksgiving <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Whatever gods may be <br>
         That no life lives for ever; <br>
         That dead men rise up never; <br>
         That even the weariest river <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Winds somewhere safe to sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then star nor sun shall waken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor any change of light: <br>
         Nor sound of waters shaken, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Nor any sound or sight: <br>
         Nor wintry leaves nor vernal, <br>
         Nor days nor things diurnal; <br>
         Only the sleep eternal <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In an eternal night. <br>

         <h3>HESPERIA</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Out</span> of the golden remote wild west where the sea without
         shore is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Full of the sunset, and sad, if at all, with the
         fulness of joy, <br>
         As a wind sets in with the autumn that blows from the region of
         stories, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Blows with a perfume of songs and of memories beloved
         from a boy, <br>
         Blows from the capes of the past oversea to the bays of the
         present, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Filled as with shadow of sound with the pulse of
         invisible feet, <br>
         Far out to the shallows and straits of the future, by rough ways
         or pleasant, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is it thither the wind's wings beat? is it hither to
         me, O my sweet? <br>
         For thee, in the stream of the deep tide-wind blowing in with the
         water, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thee I behold as a bird borne in with the wind from
         the west, <br>
         
         <center>201<br></center>
         Straight from the sunset, across white waves whence rose as a
         daughter <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Venus thy mother, in years when the world was a water
         at rest.<br>
         Out of the distance of dreams, as a dream that abides after
         slumber, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Strayed from the fugitive flock of the night, when
         the moon overhead <br>
         Wanes in the wan waste heights of the heaven, and stars without
         number <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Die without sound, and are spent like lamps that are
         burnt by the dead, <br>
         Comes back to me, stays by me, lulls me with touch of forgotten
         caresses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One warm dream clad about with a fire as of life that
         endures; <br>
         The delight of thy face, and the sound of thy feet, and the wind
         of thy tresses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And all of a man that regrets, and all of a maid that
         allures. <br>
         But thy bosom is warm for my face and profound as a manifold
         flower, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thy silence as music, thy voice as an odour that
         fades in a flame; <br>
         Not a dream, not a dream is the kiss of thy mouth, and the
         bountiful hour <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That makes me forget what was sin, and would make me
         forget were it shame. <br>
         
         <center>202<br></center>
         Thine eyes that are quiet, thine hands that are tender, thy lips
         that are loving, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Comfort and cool me as dew in the dawn of a moon like
         a dream; <br>
         And my heart yearns baffled and blind, moved vainly toward thee,
         and moving <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As the refluent seaweed moves in the languid
         exuberant stream, <br>
         Fair as a rose is on earth, as a rose under water in prison,<br>                
         
         &nbsp;
         That stretches and swings to the slow passionate
         pulse of the sea, <br>
         Closed up from the air and the sun, but alive, as a ghost
         rearisen, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Pale as the love that revives as a ghost rearisen in
         me. <br>
         From the bountiful infinite west, from the happy memorial places <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Full of the stately repose and the lordly delight of
         the dead, <br>
         Where the fortunate islands are lit with the light of ineffable
         faces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the sound of a sea without wind is about them,
         and sunset is red, <br>
         Come back to redeem and release me from love that recalls and
         represses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That cleaves to my flesh as a flame, till the serpent
         has eaten his fill; <br>
         From the bitter delights of the dark, and the feverish, the
         furtive caresses <br>
         
         <center>203<br></center>
         
         &nbsp;
         That murder the youth in a man or ever his heart have
         its will. <br>
         Thy lips cannot laugh and thine eyes cannot weep; thou art pale
         as a rose is, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Paler and sweeter than leaves that cover the blush of
         the bud; <br>
         And the heart of the flower is compassion, and pity the core it
         encloses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Pity, not love, that is born of the breath and decays
         with the blood. <br>
         As the cross that a wild nun clasps till the edge of it bruises
         her bosom, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         So love wounds as we grasp it, and blackens and burns
         as a flame;<br>
         I have loved overmuch in my life; when the live bud bursts with
         the blossom, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Bitter as ashes or tears is the fruit, and the wine
         thereof shame. <br>
         As a heart that its anguish divides is the green bud cloven
         asunder; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As the blood of a man self-slain is the flush of the
         leaves that allure; <br>
         And the perfume as poison and wine to the brain, a delight and a
         wonder; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the thorns are too sharp for a boy, too slight
         for a man, to endure. <br>
         Too soon did I love it, and lost love's rose; and I cared not for
         glory's; <br>
         
         <center>204<br></center>
         
         &nbsp;
         Only the blossoms of sleep and of pleasure were mixed
         in my hair. <br>
         Was it myrtle or poppy thy garland was woven with, O my Dolores? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Was it pallor of slumber, or blush as of blood, that
         I found in thee fair? <br>
         For desire is a respite from love, and the flesh not the heart is
         her fuel; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She was sweet to me once, who am fled and escaped
         from the rage of her reign; <br>
         Who behold as of old time at hand as I turn, with her mouth
         growing cruel, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And flushed as with wine with the blood of her
         lovers, Our Lady of Pain. <br>
         Low down where the thicket is thicker with thorns than with
         leaves in the summer, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the brake is a gleaming of eyes and a hissing of
         tongues that I knew; <br>
         And the lithe long throats of her snakes reach round her, their
         mouths overcome her,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And her lips grow cool with their foam, made moist as
         a desert with dew. <br>
         With the thirst and the hunger of lust though her beautiful lips
         be so bitter, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With the cold foul foam of the snakes they soften and
         redden and smile; <br>
         And her fierce mouth sweetens, her eyes wax wide and her
         eyelashes glitter, <br>
         
         <center>205<br></center>
         
         &nbsp;
         And she laughs with a savour of blood in her face,
         and a savour of guile. <br>
         She laughs, and her hands reach hither, her hair blows hither and
         hisses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As a low-lit flame in a wind, back-blown till it
         shudder and leap; <br>
         Let her lips not again lay hold on my soul, nor her poisonous
         kisses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To consume it alive and divide from thy bosom, Our
         Lady of Sleep. <br>
         Ah daughter of sunset and slumber, if now it return into prison, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who shall redeem it anew? but we, if thou wilt, let
         us fly; <br>
         Let us take to us, now that the white skies thrill with a moon
         unarisen, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Swift horses of fear or of love, take flight and
         depart and not die. <br>
         They are swifter than dreams, they are stronger than death; there
         is none that hath ridden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         None that shall ride in the dim strange ways of his
         life as we ride; <br>
         By the meadows of memory, the highlands of hope, and the shore
         that is hidden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where life breaks loud and unseen, a sonorous
         invisible tide;<br>
         By the sands where sorrow has trodden, the salt pools bitter and
         sterile, <br>
         
         <center>206<br></center>
         
         &nbsp;
         By the thundering reef and the low sea-wall and the
         channel of years, <br>
         Our wild steeds press on the night, strain hard through pleasure
         and peril, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Labour and listen and pant not or pause for the peril
         that nears; <br>
         And the sound of them trampling the way cleaves night as an arrow
         asunder, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And slow by the sand-hill and swift by the down with
         its glimpses of grass, <br>
         Sudden and steady the music, as eight hoofs trample and thunder, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Rings in the ear of the low blind wind of the night
         as we pass; <br>
         Shrill shrieks in our faces the blind bland air that was mute as
         a maiden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Stung into storm by the speed of our passage, and
         deaf where we past; <br>
         And our spirits too burn as we bound, thine holy but mine
         heavy-laden, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As we burn with the fire of our flight; ah love,
         shall we win at the last? <br>

         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Or sail or row? <br>
         There's many a wind and way, <br>

         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And joys that were; <br>

         Our way lies where God knows <br>

         Our seamen are fledged Loves, <br>
         Our masts are bills of doves, <br>

         Our decks fine gold; <br>

         Our ropes are dead maids' hair, <br>
         Our stores are love-shafts fair <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And manifold. <br>
         We are in love's land to-day— <br>
         
         <br><br>
         Where shall we land you, sweet? <br>
         On fields of strange men's feet, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Or fields near home? <br>
         Or where the fire-flowers blow, <br>
         Or where the flowers of snow <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Or flowers of foam? <br>
         We are in love's hand to-day— <br>
         
         <br><br>
         Land me, she says, where love <br>
         Shows but one shaft, one dove, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         One heart, one hand. <br>
         —A shore like that, my dear, <br>
         Lies where no man will steer, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         No maiden land. <br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">When</span> the fields catch flower <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the underwood is green, <br>
         And from bower unto bower <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The songs of the birds begin, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I sing with sighing between. <br>
         When I laugh and sing, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I am heavy at heart for my sin; <br>
         I am sad in the spring <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For my love that I shall not win, <br>
         For a foolish thing.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         This profit I have of my woe, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That I know, as I sing, <br>
         I know he will needs have it so <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who is master and king, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who is lord of the spirit of spring. <br>
         
         <center>210<br></center>
         I will serve her and will not spare <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till her pity awake <br>
         Who is good, who is pure, who is fair, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Even her for whose sake <br>
         Love hath ta'en me and slain unaware.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O my lord, O Love, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I have laid my life at thy feet; <br>
         Have thy will thereof, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Do as it please thee with it, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For what shall please thee is sweet. <br>
         I am come unto thee <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To do thee service, O Love; <br>
         Yet cannot I see <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou wilt take any pity thereof, <br>
         Any mercy on me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But the grace I have long time sought <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Comes never in sight, <br>
         If in her it abideth not, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Through thy mercy and might, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Whose heart is the world's delight. <br>
         Thou hast sworn without fail I shall die, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For my heart is set <br>
         On what hurts me, I wot not why, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But cannot forget <br>
         What I love, what I sing for and sigh.<br>
         
         
         <center>211<br></center>
         <br><br>
         She is worthy of praise, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For this grief of her giving is worth <br>
         All the joy of my days <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That lie between death's day and birth, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All the lordship of things upon earth. <br>
         Nay, what have I said? <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I would not be glad if I could; <br>
         My dream and my dread <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Are of her, and for her sake I would <br>
         That my life were fled.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Lo, sweet, if I durst not pray to you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then were I dead; <br>
         If I sang not a little to say to you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         (Could it be said) <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O my love, how my heart would be fed; <br>
         Ah sweet who hast hold of my heart, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For thy love's sake I live, <br>
         Do but tell me, ere either depart, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What a lover may give <br>
         For a woman so fair as thou art.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The lovers that disbelieve, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         False rumours shall grieve <br>
         And evil-speaking shall part.<br>

         <h3>BEFORE PARTING</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">A month</span> or twain to live on honeycomb <br>
         Is pleasant; but one tires of scented time, <br>
         Cold sweet recurrence of accepted rhyme, <br>
         And that strong purple under juice and foam <br>
         Where the wine's heart has burst; <br>
         Nor feel the latter kisses like the first.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Once yet, this poor one time; I will not pray <br>
         Even to change the bitterness of it, <br>
         The bitter taste ensuing on the sweet, <br>
         To make your tears fall where your soft hair lay <br>
         All blurred and heavy in some perfumed wise <br>
         Over my face and eyes.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And yet who knows what end the scythèd wheat <br>
         Makes of its foolish poppies' mouths of red? <br>
         These were not sown, these are not harvested, <br>
         They grow a month and are cast under feet <br>
         And none has care thereof, <br>
         As none has care of a divided love.<br>
         
         <center>213<br></center>
         <br><br>
         I know each shadow of your lips by rote, <br>
         Each change of love in eyelids and eyebrows; <br>
         The fashion of fair temples tremulous<br>
         With tender blood, and colour of your throat; <br>
         I know not how love is gone out of this, <br>
         Seeing that all was his.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Love's likeness there endures upon all these: <br>
         But out of these one shall not gather love. <br>
         Day hath not strength nor the night shade enough <br>
         To make love whole and fill his lips with ease, <br>
         As some bee-builded cell <br>
         Feels at filled lips the heavy honey swell.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I know not how this last month leaves your hair <br>
         Less full of purple colour and hid spice, <br>
         And that luxurious trouble of closed eyes <br>
         Is mixed with meaner shadow and waste care; <br>
         And love, kissed out by pleasure, seems not yet <br>
         Worth patience to regret. <br>

         <h3>THE SUNDEW.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">A little</span> marsh-plant, yellow green, <br>
         And pricked at lip with tender red. <br>
         Tread close, and either way you tread <br>
         Some faint black water jets between <br>
         Lest you should bruise the curious head.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         A live thing maybe; who shall know? <br>
         The summer knows and suffers it; <br>
         For the cool moss is thick and sweet <br>
         Each side, and saves the blossom so <br>
         That it lives out the long June heat.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The deep scent of the heather burns <br>
         About it; breathless though it be, <br>
         Bow down and worship; more than we <br>
         Is the least flower whose life returns, <br>
         Least weed renascent in the sea.<br>
         
         <center>215<br></center>
         <br><br>
         We are vexed and cumbered in earth's sight <br>
         With wants, with many memories; <br>
         These see their mother what she is, <br>
         Glad-growing, till August leave more bright <br>
         The apple-coloured cranberries.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Wind blows and bleaches the strong grass, <br>
         Blown all one way to shelter it <br>
         From trample of strayed kine, with feet <br>
         Felt heavier than the moorhen was, <br>
         Strayed up past patches of wild wheat.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         You call it sundew: how it grows, <br>
         If with its colour it have breath, <br>
         If life taste sweet to it, if death <br>
         Pain its soft petal, no man knows: <br>
         Man has no sight or sense that saith.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         My sundew, grown of gentle days, <br>
         In these green miles the spring begun <br>
         Thy growth ere April had half done <br>
         With the soft secret of her ways <br>
         Or June made ready for the sun.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O red-lipped mouth of marsh-flower, <br>
         I have a secret halved with thee. <br>
         The name that is love's name to me <br>
         Thou knowest, and the face of her <br>
         Who is my festival to see.<br>
         
         
         <center>216<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The hard sun, as thy petals knew, <br>
         Coloured the heavy moss-water: <br>
         Thou wert not worth green midsummer <br>
         Nor fit to live to August blue, <br>
         O sundew, not remembering her. <br>

         For last year's leaves lie dead and red<br>
         On this sweet day, in this green May,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And barren corn makes bitter bread.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What shall be said?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Here as last year the fields begin,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A fire of flowers and glowing grass;<br>
         The old fields we laughed and lingered in,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Seeing each our souls in last year's glass,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Félise, alas!<br>
         
         
         <center>218<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Shall we not laugh, shall we not weep,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Not we, though this be as it is?<br>
         For love awake or love asleep<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ends in a laugh, a dream, a kiss,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A song like this.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I that have slept awake, and you<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sleep, who last year were well awake.<br>
         Though love do all that love can do,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         My heart will never ache or break<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For your heart's sake.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The great sea, faultless as a flower,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Throbs, trembling under beam and breeze,<br>
         And laughs with love of the amorous hour.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I found you fairer once, Félise,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than flowers or seas.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We played at bondsman and at queen;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But as the days change men change too;<br>
         I find the grey sea's notes of green,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The green sea's fervent flakes of blue,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         More fair than you.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Your beauty is not over fair<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Now in mine eyes, who am grown up wise.<br>
         The smell of flowers in all your hair<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Allures not now; no sigh replies<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If your heart sighs.<br>
         
         
         <center>219<br></center>
         <br><br>
         But you sigh seldom, you sleep sound,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         You find love's new name good enough.<br>
         Less sweet I find it than I found<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The sweetest name that ever love<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Grew weary of.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         My snake with bright bland eyes, my snake<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Grown tame and glad to be caressed,<br>
         With lips athirst for mine to slake<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Their tender fever! who had guessed<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         You loved me best?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I had died for this last year, to know<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         You loved me. Who shall turn on fate?<br>
         I care not if love come or go<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Now, though your love seek mine for mate.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         It is too late.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The dust of many strange desires<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lies deep between us; in our eyes<br>
         Dead smoke of perishable fires<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Flickers, a fume in air and skies,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A steam of sighs.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         You loved me and you loved me not;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A little, much, and overmuch.<br>
         Will you forget as I forget?<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Let all dead things lie dead; none such<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Are soft to touch.<br>
         
         
         <center>220<br></center>
         <br><br>
         I love you and I do not love,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Too much, a little, not at all:<br>
         Too much, and never yet enough.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Birds quick to fledge and fly at call<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Are quick to fall.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And these love longer now than men,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And larger loves than ours are these.<br>
         No diver brings up love again<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Dropped once, my beautiful Félise,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In such cold seas.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Gone deeper than all plummets sound,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where in the dim green dayless day<br>
         The life of such dead things lies bound<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As the sea feeds on, wreck and stray<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And castaway.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Can I forget? yea, that can I,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And that can all men; so will you,<br>
         Alive, or later, when you die.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ah, but the love you plead was true?<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Was mine not too?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I loved you for that name of yours<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Long ere we met, and long enough.<br>
         Now that one thing of all endures— <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The sweetest name that ever love<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Waxed weary of.<br>
         
         
         <center>221<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Like colours in the sea, like flowers,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Like a cat's splendid circled eyes<br>
         That wax and wane with love for hours,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Green as green flame, blue-grey like skies,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And soft like sighs—<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And all these only like your name,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And your name full of all of these.<br>
         I say it, and it sounds the same— <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Save that I say it now at ease,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Your name, Félise.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I said ``she must be swift and white,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And subtly warm, and half perverse,<br>
         And sweet like sharp soft fruit to bite,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And like a snake's love lithe and fierce.''<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Men have guessed worse.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         What was the song I made of you<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Here where the grass forgets our feet<br>
         As afternoon forgets the dew?<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ah that such sweet things should be fleet,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Such fleet things sweet!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         As afternoon forgets the dew,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As time in time forgets all men,<br>
         As our old place forgets us two,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who might have turned to one thing then,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But not again.<br>
         
         <center>222<br></center>
         
         <br><br>
         
         O lips that mine have grown into
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Like April's kissing May,
         <br>
         
         O fervent eyelids letting through
         <br>
         
         Those eyes the greenest of things blue,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         The bluest of things grey,
         <br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         If you were I and I were you,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         How could I love you, say?
         <br>
         
         How could the roseleaf love the rue,
         <br>
         
         The day love nightfall and her dew,
         <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         
         Though night may love the day?
         <br>
         
         
         <br><br>
         You loved it may be more than I;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We know not; love is hard to seize,<br>
         And all things are not good to try;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And lifelong loves the worst of these<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For us, Félise.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah, take the season and have done,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Love well the hour and let it go:<br>
         Two souls may sleep and wake up one,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or dream they wake and find it so,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And then—you know.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Kiss me once hard as though a flame<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lay on my lips and made them fire;<br>
         The same lips now, and not the same;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What breath shall fill and re-inspire<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A dead desire?<br>
         
         
         <center>223<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The old song sounds hollower in mine ear<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Than thin keen sounds of dead men's speech— <br>
         A noise one hears and would not hear;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Too strong to die, too weak to reach<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From wave to beach.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We stand on either side the sea,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Stretch hands, blow kisses, laugh and lean<br>
         I toward you, you toward me;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But what hears either save the keen<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Grey sea between?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         A year divides us, love from love,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though you love now, though I loved then.<br>
         The gulf is strait, but deep enough;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who shall recross, who among men<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall cross again?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Love was a jest last year, you said,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And what lives surely, surely dies.<br>
         Even so; but now that love is dead,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shall love rekindle from wet eyes,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         From subtle sighs?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For many loves are good to see,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Mutable loves, and loves perverse;<br>
         But there is nothing, nor shall be,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         So sweet, so wicked, but my verse<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Can dream of worse.<br>
         
         <center>224<br></center>
         <br><br>
         For we that sing and you that love<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Know that which man may, only we.<br>
         The rest live under us; above,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Live the great gods in heaven, and see<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What things shall be.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         So this thing is and must be so;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For man dies, and love also dies.<br>
         Though yet love's ghost moves to and fro<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The sea-green mirrors of your eyes,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And laughs, and lies.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Eyes coloured like a water-flower,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And deeper than the green sea's glass;<br>
         Eyes that remember one sweet hour—<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In vain we swore it should not pass;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In vain, alas!<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah my Félise, if love or sin,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         If shame or fear could hold it fast,<br>
         Should we not hold it? Love wears thin,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And they laugh well who laugh the last.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is it not past?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The gods, the gods are stronger; time<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Falls down before them, all men's knees<br>
         Bow, all men's prayers and sorrows climb<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Like incense towards them; yea, for these<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Are gods, Félise.<br>
         
         
         <center>225<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Immortal are they, clothed with powers,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Not to be comforted at all;<br>
         Lords over all the fruitless hours;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Too great to appease, too high to appal,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Too far to call.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For none shall move the most high gods,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Who are most sad, being cruel; none<br>
         Shall break or take away the rods<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wherewith they scourge us, not as one<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That smites a son.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         By many a name of many a creed<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         We have called upon them, since the sands<br>
         Fell through time's hour-glass first, a seed<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of life; and out of many lands<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Have we stretched hands.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         When have they heard us? who hath known<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Their faces, climbed unto their feet,<br>
         Felt them and found them? Laugh or groan,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Doth heaven remurmur and repeat<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Sad sounds or sweet?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Do the stars answer? in the night<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Have ye found comfort? or by day<br>
         Have ye seen gods? What hope, what light,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Falls from the farthest starriest way<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         On you that pray?<br>
         
         
         <center>226<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Are the skies wet because we weep,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or fair because of any mirth?<br>
         Cry out; they are gods; perchance they sleep;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Cry; thou shalt know what prayers are worth,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Thou dust and earth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O earth, thou art fair; O dust, thou art great;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O laughing lips and lips that mourn,<br>
         Pray, till ye feel the exceeding weight<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Of God's intolerable scorn,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Not to be borne.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Behold, there is no grief like this;<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The barren blossom of thy prayer,<br>
         Thou shalt find out how sweet it is.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O fools and blind, what seek ye there,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         High up in the air?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ye must have gods, the friends of men,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Merciful gods, compassionate,<br>
         And these shall answer you again.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Will ye beat always at the gate,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ye fools of fate?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ye fools and blind; for this is sure,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That all ye shall not live, but die.<br>
         Lo, what thing have ye found endure?<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or what thing have ye found on high<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Past the blind sky?<br>
         
         
         <center>227<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The ghosts of words and dusty dreams,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Old memories, faiths infirm and dead.<br>
         Ye fools; for which among you deems<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         His prayer can alter green to red<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or stones to bread?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Why should ye bear with hopes and fears<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Till all these things be drawn in one,<br>
         The sound of iron-footed years,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And all the oppression that is done<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Under the sun?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ye might end surely, surely pass<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Out of the multitude of things,<br>
         Under the dust, beneath the grass,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Deep in dim death, where no thought stings,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No record clings.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         No memory more of love or hate,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         No trouble, nothing that aspires,<br>
         No sleepless labour thwarting fate,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And thwarted; where no travail tires,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Where no faith fires.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All passes, nought that has been is,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Things good and evil have one end.<br>
         Can anything be otherwise<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though all men swear all things would mend<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         With God to friend?<br>
         
         
         <center>228<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Can ye beat off one wave with prayer,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Can ye move mountains? bid the flower<br>
         Take flight and turn to a bird in the air?<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Can ye hold fast for shine or shower<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One wingless hour?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah sweet, and we too, can we bring<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         One sigh back, bid one smile revive?<br>
         Can God restore one ruined thing,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or he who slays our souls alive<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Make dead things thrive?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Two gifts perforce he has given us yet,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Though sad things stay and glad things fly;<br>
         Two gifts he has given us, to forget<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All glad and sad things that go by,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And then to die.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We know not whether death be good,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But life at least it will not be:<br>
         Men will stand saddening as we stood,<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Watch the same fields and skies as we<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the same sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Let this be said between us here,<br>

         This year knows nothing of last year;<br>

         Live and let live, as I will do,<br>

         Love and let love, and so will I.<br>
         But, sweet, for me no more with you:<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Not while I live, not though I die.<br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Goodnight, goodbye.<br>

         <h3>AN INTERLUDE.</h3>
         <br><br>
          In the greenest growth of the Maytime, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          I rode where the woods were wet, <br>
          Between the dawn and the daytime; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          The spring was glad that we met. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          There was something the season wanted, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          Though the ways and the woods smelt sweet; <br>
          The breath at your lips that panted, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          The pulse of the grass at your feet. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          You came, and the sun came after, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          And the green grew golden above; <br>
          And the flag-flowers lightened with laughter, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          And the meadow-sweet shook with love. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          Your feet in the full-grown grasses <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          Moved soft as a weak wind blows; <br>
          You passed me as April passes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          With face made out of a rose. <br>
         
         
         <center>231<br></center>
         <br><br>
          By the stream where the stems were slender, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          Your bright foot paused at the sedge; <br>
          It might be to watch the tender <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          Light leaves in the springtime hedge, <br>
         
         <br><br>
          On boughs that the sweet month blanches <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          With flowery frost of May: <br>
          It might be a bird in the branches, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          It might be a thorn in the way. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          I waited to watch you linger <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          With foot drawn back from the dew, <br>
          Till a sunbeam straight like a finger <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          Struck sharp through the leaves at you. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          And a bird overhead sang <i>Follow</i>, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          And a bird to the right sang <i>Here;</i> <br>
          And the arch of the leaves was hollow, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          And the meaning of May was clear. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          I saw where the sun's hand pointed, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          I knew what the bird's note said; <br>
          By the dawn and the dewfall anointed, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          You were queen by the gold on your head. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          As the glimpse of a burnt-out ember <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          Recalls a regret of the sun, <br>
          I remember, forget, and remember <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          What Love saw done and undone. <br>
         
         
         <center>232<br></center>
         <br><br>
          I remember the way we parted, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          The day and the way we met; <br>
          You hoped we were both broken-hearted, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          And knew we should both forget. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          And May with her world in flower <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          Seemed still to murmur and smile <br>
          As you murmured and smiled for an hour; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          I saw you turn at the stile. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          A hand like a white wood-blossom <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          You lifted, and waved, and passed, <br>
          With head hung down to the bosom, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          And pale, as it seemed, at last. <br>
         
         <br><br>
          And the best and the worst of this is <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          That neither is most to blame <br>
          If you've forgotten my kisses <br>
         
         &nbsp;
          And I've forgotten your name. <br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">In </span>the month of the long decline of roses <br>
         I, beholding the summer dead before me, <br>
         Set my face to the sea and journeyed silent, <br>
         Gazing eagerly where above the sea-mark <br>
         Flame as fierce as the fervid eyes of lions <br>
         Half divided the eyelids of the sunset; <br>
         Till I heard as it were a noise of waters <br>
         Moving tremulous under feet of angels <br>
         Multitudinous, out of all the heavens; <br>
         Knew the fluttering wind, the fluttered foliage, <br>
         Shaken fitfully, full of sound and shadow; <br>
         And saw, trodden upon by noiseless angels, <br>
         Long mysterious reaches fed with moonlight, <br>
         Sweet sad straits in a soft subsiding channel, <br>
         Blown about by the lips of winds I knew not, <br>
         Winds not born in the north nor any quarter, <br>
         Winds not warm with the south nor any sunshine; <br>
         Heard between them a voice of exultation, <br>
         "Lo, the summer is dead, the sun is faded, <br>
         Even like as a leaf the year is withered, <br>
         
         <center>234<br></center>
         All the fruits of the day from all her branches <br>
         Gathered, neither is any left to gather. <br>
         All the flowers are dead, the tender blossoms, <br>
         All are taken away; the season wasted, <br>
         Like an ember among the fallen ashes.<br>
         Now with light of the winter days, with moonlight, <br>
         Light of snow, and the bitter light of hoarfrost, <br>
         We bring flowers that fade not after autumn, <br>
         Pale white chaplets and crowns of latter seasons, <br>
         Fair false leaves (but the summer leaves were falser), <br>
         Woven under the eyes of stars and planets <br>
         When low light was upon the windy reaches <br>
         Where the flower of foam was blown, a lily <br>
         Dropt among the sonorous fruitless furrows <br>
         And green fields of the sea that make no pasture: <br>
         Since the winter begins, the weeping winter, <br>
         All whose flowers are tears, and round his temples <br>
         Iron blossom of frost is bound for ever." <br>

         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">All</span> the night sleep came not upon my eyelids, <br>
         Shed not dew, nor shook nor unclosed a feather, <br>
         Yet with lips shut close and with eyes of iron <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Stood and beheld me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then to me so lying awake a vision <br>
         Came without sleep over the seas and touched me, <br>
         Softly touched mine eyelids and lips; and I too, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Full of the vision,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Saw the white implacable Aphrodite, <br>
         Saw the hair unbound and the feet unsandalled <br>
         Shine as fire of sunset on western waters; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Saw the reluctant<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Feet, the straining plumes of the doves that drew her, <br>
         Looking always, looking with necks reverted, <br>
         Back to Lesbos, back to the hills whereunder <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Shone Mitylene;<br>
         
         
         <center>236<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Heard the flying feet of the Loves behind her <br>
         Make a sudden thunder upon the waters, <br>
         As the thunder flung from the strong unclosing <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wings of a great wind.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         So the goddess fled from her place, with awful <br>
         Sound of feet and thunder of wings around her; <br>
         While behind a clamour of singing women <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Severed the twilight.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Ah the singing, ah the delight, the passion! <br>
         All the Loves wept, listening; sick with anguish, <br>
         Stood the crowned nine Muses about Apollo; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fear was upon them,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         While the tenth sang wonderful things they knew not. <br>
         Ah the tenth, the Lesbian! the nine were silent, <br>
         None endured the sound of her song for weeping; <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Laurel by laurel,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Faded all their crowns; but about her forehead, <br>
         Round her woven tresses and ashen temples <br>
         White as dead snow, paler than grass in summer, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Ravaged with kisses,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Shone a light of fire as a crown for ever. <br>
         Yea, almost the implacable Aphrodite <br>
         Paused, and almost wept; such a song was that song. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yea, by her name too<br>
         
         
         <center>237<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Called her, saying, ''Turn to me, O my Sappho;'' <br>
         Yet she turned her face from the Loves, she saw not <br>
         Tears for laughter darken immortal eyelids, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Heard not about her<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Fearful fitful wings of the doves departing, <br>
         Saw not how the bosom of Aphrodite <br>
         Shook with weeping, saw not her shaken raiment, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Saw not her hands wrung;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Saw the Lesbians kissing across their smitten <br>
         Lutes with lips more sweet than the sound of lute-strings, <br>
         Mouth to mouth and hand upon hand, her chosen, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fairer than all men;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Only saw the beautiful lips and fingers, <br>
         Full of songs and kisses and little whispers, <br>
         Full of music; only beheld among them <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Soar, as a bird soars<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Newly fledged, her visible song, a marvel, <br>
         Made of perfect sound and exceeding passion, <br>
         Sweetly shapen, terrible, full of thunders, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Clothed with the wind's wings.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then rejoiced she, laughing with love, and scattered <br>
         Roses, awful roses of holy blossom; <br>
         Then the Loves thronged sadly with hidden faces <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Round Aphrodite,<br>
         
         
         <center>238<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Then the Muses, stricken at heart, were silent; <br>
         Yea, the gods waxed pale; such a song was that song. <br>
         All reluctant, all with a fresh repulsion, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fled from before her.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All withdrew long since, and the land was barren, <br>
         Full of fruitless women and music only. <br>
         Now perchance, when winds are assuaged at sunset, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lulled at the dewfall,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         By the grey sea-side, unassuaged, unheard of, <br>
         Unbeloved, unseen in the ebb of twilight, <br>
         Ghosts of outcast women return lamenting, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Purged not in Lethe,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Clothed about with flame and with tears, and singing <br>
         Songs that move the heart of the shaken heaven, <br>
         Songs that break the heart of the earth with pity, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Hearing, to hear them. <br>

         <h3> AT ELEUSIS. </h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase"> Men </span> of Eleusis, ye that with long staves <br>
          Sit in the market-houses, and speak words <br>
          Made sweet with wisdom as the rare wine is <br>
          Thickened with honey; and ye sons of these <br>
          Who in the glad thick streets go up and down <br>
          For pastime or grave traffic or mere chance; <br>
          And all fair women having rings of gold <br>
          On hands or hair; and chiefest over these <br>
          I name you, daughters of this man the king, <br>
          Who dipping deep smooth pitchers of pure brass <br>
          Under the bubbled wells, till each round lip <br>
          Stooped with loose gurgle of waters incoming, <br>
          Found me an old sick woman, lamed and lean, <br>
          Beside a growth of builded olive-boughs <br>
          Whence multiplied thick song of thick-plumed throats— <br>
          Also wet tears filled up my hollow hands <br>
          By reason of my crying into them— <br>
          And pitied me; for as cold water ran <br>
          And washed the pitchers full from lip to lip, <br>
          So washed both eyes full the strong salt of tears. <br>
         
         <center>240<br></center>
          And ye put water to my mouth, made sweet <br>
          With brown hill-berries; so in time I spoke <br>
          And gathered my loose knees from under me. <br>
          Moreover in the broad fair halls this month <br>
          Have I found space and bountiful abode <br>
          To please me. I Demeter speak of this, <br>
          Who am the mother and the mate of things: <br>
          For as ill men by drugs or singing words <br>
          Shut the doors inward of the narrowed womb <br>
          Like a lock bolted with round iron through, <br>
          Thus I shut up the body and sweet mouth <br>
          Of all soft pasture and the tender land, <br>
          So that no seed can enter in by it <br>
          Though one sow thickly, nor some grain get out <br>
          Past the hard clods men cleave and bite with steel <br>
          To widen the sealed lips of them for use. <br>
          None of you is there in the peopled street <br>
          But knows how all the dry-drawn furrows ache <br>
          With no green spot made count of in the black: <br>
          How the wind finds no comfortable grass <br>
          Nor is assuaged with bud nor breath of herbs; <br>
          And in hot autumn when ye house the stacks, <br>
          All fields are helpless in the sun, all trees <br>
          Stand as a man stripped out of all but skin. <br>
          Nevertheless ye sick have help to get <br>
          By means and stablished ordinance of God; <br>
          For God is wiser than a good man is. <br>
          But never shall new grass be sweet in earth <br>
         
         <center>241<br></center>
          Till I get righted of my wound and wrong <br>
          By changing counsel of ill-minded Zeus. <br>
          For of all other gods is none save me <br>
          Clothed with like power to build and break the year. <br>
          I make the lesser green begin, when spring <br>
          Touches not earth but with one fearful foot; <br>
          And as a careful gilder with grave art <br>
          Soberly colours and completes the face, <br>
          Mouth, chin and all, of some sweet work in stone, <br>
          I carve the shapes of grass and tender corn <br>
          And colour the ripe edges and long spikes <br>
          With the red increase and the grace of gold. <br>
          No tradesman in soft wools is cunninger <br>
          To kill the secret of the fat white fleece <br>
          With stains of blue and purple wrought in it. <br>
          Three moons were made and three moons burnt away <br>
          While I held journey hither out of Crete <br>
          Comfortless, tended by grave Hecate <br>
          Whom my wound stung with double iron point; <br>
          For all my face was like a cloth wrung out <br>
          With close and weeping wrinkles, and both lids <br>
          Sodden with salt continuance of tears. <br>
          For Hades and the sidelong will of Zeus <br>
          And that lame wisdom that has writhen feet, <br>
          Cunning, begotten in the bed of Shame, <br>
          These three took evil will at me, and made <br>
          Such counsel that when time got wing to fly <br>
          This Hades out of summer and low fields <br>
         
         <center>242<br></center>
          Forced the bright body of Persephone: <br>
          Out of pure grass, where she lying down, red flowers <br>
          Made their sharp little shadows on her sides, <br>
          Pale heat, pale colour on pale maiden flesh— <br>
          And chill water slid over her reddening feet, <br>
          Killing the throbs in their soft blood; and birds, <br>
          Perched next her elbow and pecking at her hair, <br>
          Stretched their necks more to see her than even to sing. <br>
          A sharp thing is it I have need to say; <br>
          For Hades holding both white wrists of hers <br>
          Unloosed the girdle and with knot by knot <br>
          Bound her between his wheels upon the seat, <br>
          Bound her pure body, holiest yet and dear <br>
          To me and God as always, clothed about <br>
          With blossoms loosened as her knees went down, <br>
          Let fall as she let go of this and this <br>
          By tens and twenties, tumbled to her feet, <br>
          White waifs or purple of the pasturage. <br>
          Therefore with only going up and down <br>
          My feet were wasted, and the gracious air, <br>
          To me discomfortable and dun, became <br>
          As weak smoke blowing in the under world. <br>
          And finding in the process of ill days <br>
          What part had Zeus herein, and how as mate <br>
          He coped with Hades, yokefellow in sin, <br>
          I set my lips against the meat of gods <br>
          And drank not neither ate or slept in heaven. <br>
          Nor in the golden greeting of their mouths <br>
         
         <center>243<br></center>
          Did ear take note of me, nor eye at all <br>
          Track my feet going in the ways of them. <br>
          Like a great fire on some strait slip of land <br>
          Between two washing inlets of wet sea <br>
          That burns the grass up to each lip of beach <br>
          And strengthens, waxing in the growth of wind, <br>
          So burnt my soul in me at heaven and earth, <br>
          Each way a ruin and a hungry plague, <br>
          Visible evil; nor could any night <br>
          Put cool between mine eyelids, nor the sun <br>
          With competence of gold fill out my want. <br>
          Yea so my flame burnt up the grass and stones, <br>
          Shone to the salt-white edges of thin sea, <br>
          Distempered all the gracious work, and made <br>
          Sick change, unseasonable increase of days <br>
          And scant avail of seasons; for by this <br>
          The fair gods faint in hollow heaven: there comes <br>
          No taste of burnings of the twofold fat <br>
          To leave their palates smooth, nor in their lips <br>
          Soft rings of smoke and weak scent wandering; <br>
          All cattle waste and rot, and their ill smell <br>
          Grows alway from the lank unsavoury flesh <br>
          That no man slays for offering; the sea <br>
          And waters moved between the heath and corn <br>
          Preserve the people of fin-twinkling fish, <br>
          And river-flies feed thick upon the smooth; <br>
          But all earth over is no man or bird <br>
          (Except the sweet race of the kingfisher) <br>
         
         <center>244<br></center>
          That lacks not and is wearied with much loss. <br>
          Meantime the purple inward of the house <br>
          Was softened with all grace of scent and sound <br>
          In ear and nostril perfecting my praise; <br>
          Faint grape-flowers and cloven honey-cake <br>
          And the just grain with dues of the shed salt <br>
          Made me content: yet my hand loosened not <br>
          Its gripe upon your harvest all year long. <br>
          While I, thus woman-muffled in wan flesh <br>
          And waste externals of a perished face, <br>
          Preserved the levels of my wrath and love <br>
          Patiently ruled; and with soft offices <br>
          Cooled the sharp noons and busied the warm nights <br>
          In care of this my choice, this child my choice, <br>
          Triptolemus, the king's selected son: <br>
          That this fair yearlong body, which hath grown <br>
          Strong with strange milk upon the mortal lip <br>
          And nerved with half a god, might so increase <br>
          Outside the bulk and the bare scope of man: <br>
          And waxen over large to hold within <br>
          Base breath of yours and this impoverished air, <br>
          I might exalt him past the flame of stars, <br>
          The limit and walled reach of the great world. <br>
          Therefore my breast made common to his mouth <br>
          Immortal savours, and the taste whereat <br>
          Twice their hard life strains out the coloured veins <br>
          And twice its brain confirms the narrow shell. <br>
          Also at night, unwinding cloth from cloth <br>
         
         <center>245<br></center>
          As who unhusks an almond to the white <br>
          And pastures curiously the purer taste, <br>
          I bared the gracious limbs and the soft feet, <br>
          Unswaddled the weak hands, and in mid ash <br>
          Laid the sweet flesh of either feeble side, <br>
          More tender for impressure of some touch <br>
          Than wax to any pen; and lit around <br>
          Fire, and made crawl the white worm-shapen flame, <br>
          And leap in little angers spark by spark <br>
          At head at once and feet; and the faint hair <br>
          Hissed with rare sprinkles in the closer curl, <br>
          And like scaled oarage of a keen thin fish <br>
          In sea-water, so in pure fire his feet <br>
          Struck out, and the flame bit not in his flesh <br>
          But like a kiss it curled his lip, and heat <br>
          Fluttered his eyelids; so each night I blew <br>
          The hot ash red to purge him to full god. <br>
          Ill is it when fear hungers in the soul <br>
          For painful food, and chokes thereon, being fed; <br>
          And ill slant eyes interpret the straight sun, <br>
          But in their scope its white is wried to black: <br>
          By the queen Metaneira mean I this; <br>
          For with sick wrath upon her lips, and heart, <br>
          Narrowing with fear the spleenful passages, <br>
          She thought to thread this web's fine ravel out, <br>
          Nor leave her shuttle split in combing it; <br>
          Therefore she stole on us, and with hard sight <br>
          Peered, and stooped close; then with pale open mouth <br>
         
         <center>246<br></center>
          As the fire smote her in the eyes between <br>
          Cried, and the child's laugh, sharply shortening <br>
          As fire doth under rain, fell off; the flame <br>
          Writhed once all through and died, and in thick dark <br>
          Tears fell from mine on the child's weeping eyes, <br>
          Eyes dispossessed of strong inheritance <br>
          And mortal fallen anew. Who not the less <br>
          From bud of beard to pale-grey flower of hair <br>
          Shall wax vinewise to a lordly vine, whose grapes <br>
          Bleed the red heavy blood of swoln soft wine, <br>
          Subtle with sharp leaves' intricacy, until <br>
          Full of white years and blossom of hoary days <br>
          I take him perfected; for whose one sake <br>
          I am thus gracious to the least who stands <br>
          Filleted with white wool and girt upon <br>
          As he whose prayer endures upon the lip <br>
          And falls not waste: wherefore let sacrifice <br>
          Burn and run red in all the wider ways; <br>
          Seeing I have sworn by the pale temples' band <br>
          And poppied hair of gold Persephone <br>
          Sad-tressed and pleached low down about her brows, <br>
          And by the sorrow in her lips, and death <br>
          Her dumb and mournful-mouthèd minister, <br>
          My word for you is eased of its harsh weight <br>
          And doubled with soft promise; and your king <br>
          Triptolemus, this Celeus dead and swathed <br>
          Purple and pale for golden burial, <br>
          Shall be your helper in my services, <br>
         
         <center>247<br></center>
          Dividing earth and reaping fruits thereof <br>
          In fields where wait, well-girt, well-wreathen, all <br>
          The heavy-handed seasons all year through; <br>
          Saving the choice of warm spear-headed grain, <br>
          And stooping sharp to the slant-sided share <br>
          All beasts that furrow the remeasured land <br>
          With their bowed necks of burden equable. <br>

         <h3>AUGUST</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">There</span> were four apples on the bough, <br>
         Half gold half red, that one might know <br>
         The blood was ripe inside the core; <br>
         The colour of the leaves was more <br>
         Like stems of yellow corn that grow <br>
         Through all the gold June meadow's floor.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The warm smell of the fruit was good <br>
         To feed on, and the split green wood, <br>
         With all its bearded lips and stains <br>
         Of mosses in the cloven veins, <br>
         Most pleasant, if one lay or stood <br>
         In sunshine or in happy rains.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There were four apples on the tree, <br>
         Red stained through gold, that all might see <br>
         The sun went warm from core to rind; <br>
         The green leaves made the summer blind <br>
         In that soft place they kept for me <br>
         With golden apples shut behind.<br>
         
         
         <center>249<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The leaves caught gold across the sun, <br>
         And where the bluest air begun,<br>
         Thirsted for song to help the heat; <br>
         As I to feel my lady's feet <br>
         Draw close before the day were done; <br>
         Both lips grew dry with dreams of it.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In the mute August afternoon <br>
         They trembled to some undertune <br>
         Of music in the silver air; <br>
         Great pleasure was it to be there <br>
         Till green turned duskier and the moon <br>
         Coloured the corn-sheaves like gold hair.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         That August time it was delight <br>
         To watch the red moons wane to white <br>
         'Twixt grey seamed stems of apple-trees; <br>
         A sense of heavy harmonies <br>
         Grew on the growth of patient night, <br>
         More sweet than shapen music is.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But some three hours before the moon <br>
         The air, still eager from the noon, <br>
         Flagged after heat, not wholly dead; <br>
         Against the stem I leant my head; <br>
         The colour soothed me like a tune, <br>
         Green leaves all round the gold and red.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         I lay there till the warm smell grew <br>
         More sharp, when flecks of yellow dew <br>
         
         <center>250<br></center>
         Between the round ripe leaves had blurred <br>
         The rind with stain and wet; I heard <br>
         A wind that blew and breathed and blew, <br>
         Too weak to alter its one word.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The wet leaves next the gentle fruit <br>
         Felt smoother, and the brown tree-root <br>
         Felt the mould warmer: I too felt <br>
         (As water feels the slow gold melt <br>
         Right through it when the day burns mute) <br>
         The peace of time wherein love dwelt.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There were four apples on the tree, <br>
         Gold stained on red that all might see <br>
         The sweet blood filled them to the core: <br>
         The colour of her hair is more <br>
         Like stems of fair faint gold, that be <br>
         Mown from the harvest's middle floor. <br>

         <h3>A CHRISTMAS CAROL.*
            
         </h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Three</span> damsels in the queen's chamber, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The queen's mouth was most fair; <br>
         She spake a word of God's mother <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As the combs went in her hair. <br>
         Mary that is of might, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's sight.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They held the gold combs out from her, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         A span's length off her head; <br>
         She sang this song of God's mother <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And of her bearing-bed. <br>
         Mary most full of grace, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's face.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         When she sat at Joseph's hand, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         She looked against her side; <br>
         And either way from the short silk band <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Her girdle was all wried. <br>
         Mary that all good may, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's way.<br>
         
         
         <center>252<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Mary had three women for her bed, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The twain were maidens clean; <br>
         The first of them had white and red, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The third had riven green. <br>
         Mary that is so sweet, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's feet.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She had three women for her hair, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Two were gloved soft and shod; <br>
         The third had feet and fingers bare, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         She was the likest God. <br>
         Mary that wieldeth land, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's hand.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She had three women for her ease, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The twain were good women: <br>
         The first two were the two Maries, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The third was Magdalen. <br>
         Mary that perfect is, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's kiss.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Joseph had three workmen in his stall, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To serve him well upon; <br>
         The first of them were Peter and Paul, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The third of them was John. <br>
         Mary, God's handmaiden, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's ken.<br>
         
         
         <center>253<br></center>
         <br><br>
         "If your child be none other man's, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But if it be very mine, <br>
         The bedstead shall be gold two spans, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The bedfoot silver fine." <br>
         Mary that made God mirth, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's birth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         "If the child be some other man's, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And if it be none of mine, <br>
         The manger shall be straw two spans, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Betwixen kine and kine." <br>
         Mary that made sin cease, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's peace.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Christ was born upon this wise, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         It fell on such a night, <br>
         Neither with sounds of psalteries, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Nor with fire for light. <br>
         Mary that is God's spouse, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's house.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The star came out upon the east <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With a great sound and sweet: <br>
         Kings gave gold to make him feast <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And myrrh for him to eat. <br>
         Mary, of thy sweet mood, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's good.<br>
         
         
         <center>254<br></center>
         <br><br>
         He had two handmaids at his head, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         One handmaid at his feet; <br>
         The twain of them were fair and red, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The third one was right sweet. <br>
         Mary that is most wise, <br>
         Bring us to thy Son's eyes. Amen.<br>

         <h3>THE MASQUE OF QUEEN BERSABE.</h3>
         
         <h3>A MIRACLE-PLAY.</h3>
         
         KING DAVID.
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Knights</span> mine, all that be in hall, <br>
         I have a counsel to you all, <br>
         Because of this thing God lets fall <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Among us for a sign. <br>
         For some days hence as I did eat <br>
         From kingly dishes my good meat, <br>
         There flew a bird between my feet <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As red as any wine. <br>
         This bird had a long bill of red <br>
         And a gold ring above his head; <br>
         Long time he sat and nothing said, <br>
         Put softly down his neck and fed <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         From the gilt patens fine: <br>
         And as I marvelled, at the last <br>
         He shut his two keen eyën fast <br>
         And suddenly woxe big and brast <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Ere one should tell to nine.<br>
         
         
         
         <center>256<br></center>
         
         PRIMUS MILES.
         <br><br>
         Sir, note this that I will say; <br>
         That Lord who maketh corn with hay <br>
         And morrows each of yesterday, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         He hath you in his hand.<br>
         
         
         
         SECUNDUS MILES (Paganus
         quidam).
         
         <br><br>
         By Satan I hold no such thing; <br>
         For if wine swell within a king <br>
         Whose ears for drink are hot and ring, <br>
         The same shall dream of wine-bibbing <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whilst he can lie or stand.<br>
         
         
         
         QUEEN BERSABE. 
         <br><br>
         Peace now, lords, for Godis head, <br>
         Ye chirk as starlings that be fed <br>
         And gape as fishes newly dead; <br>
         The devil put your bones to bed, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Lo, this is all to say.<br>
         
         
         
         SECUNDUS MILES. 
         <br><br>
         By Mahound, lords, I have good will <br>
         This devil's bird to wring and spill; <br>
         For now meseems our game goes ill, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Ye have scant hearts to play.<br>
         
         
         
         TERTIUS MILES. 
         <br><br>
         Lo, sirs, this word is there said, <br>
         That Urias the knight is dead <br>
         
         <center>257<br></center>
         Through some ill craft; by Poulis head, <br>
         I doubt his blood hath made so red <br>
         This bird that flew from the queen's bed <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whereof ye have such fear.<br>
         
         
         
         KING DAVID. 
         <br><br>
         Yea, my good knave, and is it said <br>
         That I can raise men from the dead? <br>
         By God I think to have his head <br>
         Who saith words of my lady's bed <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For any thief to hear. <br>
         
         
         Et percutiat eum in capite.
         
         QUEEN BERSABE. 
         <br><br>
         I wis men shall spit at me, <br>
         And say, it were but right for thee <br>
         That one should hang thee on a tree; <br>
         Ho! it were a fair thing to see <br>
         The big stones bruise her false body; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Fie! who shall see her dead?<br>
         
         
         
         KING DAVID. 
         <br><br>
         I rede you have no fear of this, <br>
         For, as ye wot, the first good kiss <br>
         I had must be the last of his; <br>
         Now are ye queen of mine, I wis, <br>
         And lady of a house that is <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Full rich of meat and bread.<br>
         
         
         
         <center>258<br></center>
         
         PRIMUS MILES. 
         <br><br>
         I bid you make good cheer to be <br>
         So fair a queen as all men see, <br>
         And hold us for your lieges free; <br>
         By Peter's soul that hath the key, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Ye have good hap of it.<br>
         
         
         
         SECUNDUS MILES. 
         <br><br>
         I would that he were hanged and dead <br>
         Who hath no joy to see your head <br>
         With gold about it, barred on red; <br>
         I hold him as a sow of lead <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That is so scant of wit.<br>
         
         
         
         
         Tunc dicat
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Nathan</span>

         <br><br>
         O king, I have a word to thee; <br>
         The child that is in Bersabe <br>
         Shall wither without light to see; <br>
         This word is come of God by me <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For sin that ye have done. <br>
         Because herein ye did not right, <br>
         To take the fair one lamb to smite <br>
         That was of Urias the knight; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Ye wist he had but one. <br>
         Full many sheep I wot ye had, <br>
         And many women, when ye bade, <br>
         To do your will and keep you glad; <br>
         And a good crown about your head <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With gold to show thereon. <br>
         
         <center>259<br></center>
         This Urias had one poor house <br>
         With low-barred latoun shot-windows <br>
         And scant of corn to fill a mouse; <br>
         And rusty basnets for his brows, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To wear them to the bone. <br>
         Yea the roofs also, as men sain, <br>
         Were thin to hold against the rain; <br>
         Therefore what rushes were there lain <br>
         Grew wet withouten foot of men; <br>
         The stancheons were all gone in twain <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As sick man's flesh is gone.<br>
         Nathless he had great joy to see <br>
         The long hair of this Bersabe <br>
         Fall round her lap and round her knee <br>
         Even to her small soft feet, that be <br>
         Shod now with crimson royally <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And covered with clean gold. <br>
         Likewise great joy he had to kiss <br>
         Her throat, where now the scarlet is <br>
         Against her little chin, I wis, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That then was but cold. <br>
         No scarlet then her kirtle had <br>
         And little gold about it sprad; <br>
         But her red mouth was alway glad <br>
         To kiss, albeit the eyes were sad <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With love they had to hold.<br>
         
         
         
         <center>260<br></center>
         
         SECUNDUS MILES. 
         <br><br>
         How! old thief, thy wits are lame; <br>
         To clip such it is no shame; <br>
         I rede you in the devil's name, <br>
         Ye come not here to make men game; <br>
         By Termagaunt that maketh grame, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         I shall to-bete thine head. <br>
         
         Hic Diabolus capiat eum.
         <br><br>
         This knave hath sharp fingers, perfay; <br>
         Mahound you thank and keep alway, <br>
         And give you good knees to pray; <br>
         What man hath no lust to play, <br>
         The devil wring his ears, I say; <br>
         There is no more but wellaway, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         For now am I dead.<br>
         
         
         
         KING DAVID. 
         <br><br>
         Certes his mouth is wried and black, <br>
         Full little pence be in his sack; <br>
         This devil hath him by the back, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         It is no boot to lie.<br>
         
         
         
         NATHAN. 
         <br><br>
         Sitteth now still and learn of me; <br>
         A little while and ye shall see <br>
         The face of God's strength presently. <br>
         All queens made as this Bersabe, <br>
         
         <center>261<br></center>
         All that were fair and foul ye be, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Come hither; it am I.<br>
         
         
         Et hìc omnes cantabunt.
         
         HERODIAS. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Herodias. <br>
         This headband of my temples was <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         King Herod's gold band woven me. <br>
         This broken dry staff in my hand <br>
         Was the queen's staff of a great land <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Betwixen Perse and Samarie. <br>
         For that one dancing of my feet, <br>
         The fire is come in my green wheat, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         From one sea to the other sea.<br>
         
         
         
         AHOLIBAH. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Aholibah. <br>
         My lips kissed dumb the word of <i>Ah</i>
         <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Sighed on strange lips grown sick thereby. <br>
         God wrought to me my royal bed; <br>
         The inner work thereof was red, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The outer work was ivory.<br>
         My mouth's heat was the heat of flame <br>
         For lust towards the kings that came <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With horsemen riding royally.<br>
         
         
         
         CLEOPATRA. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Ethiope. <br>
         
         <center>262<br></center>
         Love bade my kissing eyelids ope <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That men beholding might praise love. <br>
         My hair was wonderful and curled; <br>
         My lips held fast the mouth o' the world <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To spoil the strength and speech thereof. <br>
         The latter triumph in my breath <br>
         Bowed down the beaten brows of death, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Ashamed they had not wrath enough.<br>
         
         
         
         ABIHAIL. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Tyrians. <br>
         My hair was glorious for twelve spans, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That dried to loose dust afterward. <br>
         My stature was a strong man's length; <br>
         My neck was like a place of strength <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Built with white walls, even and hard. <br>
         Like the first noise of rain leaves catch <br>
         One from another, snatch by snatch, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Is my praise, hissed against and marred.<br>
         
         
         
         AZUBAH. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Amorites. <br>
         My face was like a place of lights <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With multitudes at festival. <br>
         The glory of my gracious brows <br>
         Was like God's house made glorious <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With colours upon either wall.<br>
         Between my brows and hair there was <br>
         
         <center>263<br></center>
         A white space like a space of glass <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With golden candles over all.<br>
         
         
         
         AHOLAH. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Amalek. <br>
         There was no tender touch or fleck <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To spoil my body or bared feet. <br>
         My words were soft like dulcimers, <br>
         And the first sweet of grape-flowers <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Made each side of my bosom sweet. <br>
         My raiment was as tender fruit <br>
         Whose rind smells sweet of spice-tree root, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Bruised balm-blossom and budded wheat.<br>
         
         
         
         AHINOAM. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Ahinoam. <br>
         Like the throat of a soft slain lamb <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Was my throat, softer veined than his: <br>
         My lips were as two grapes the sun <br>
         Lays his whole weight of heat upon <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Like a mouth heavy with a kiss: <br>
         My hair's pure purple a wrought fleece, <br>
         My temples therein as a piece <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Of a pomegranate's cleaving is.<br>
         
         
         
         ATARAH. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Sidonian. <br>
         My face made faint the face of man, <br>
         
         <center>264<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And strength was bound between my brows. <br>
         Spikenard was hidden in my ships, <br>
         Honey and wheat and myrrh in strips, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         White wools that shine as colour does,<br>
         Soft linen dyed upon the fold, <br>
         Split spice and cores of scented gold, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Cedar and broken calamus.<br>
         
         
         
         SEMIRAMIS. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Semiramis. <br>
         The whole world and the sea that is <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         In fashion like a chrysopras, <br>
         The noise of all men labouring, <br>
         The priest's mouth tired through thanksgiving, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The sound of love in the blood's pause, <br>
         The strength of love in the blood's beat, <br>
         All these were cast beneath my feet <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And all found lesser than I was.<br>
         
         
         
         HESIONE. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Hesione. <br>
         The seasons that increased in me <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Made my face fairer than all men's. <br>
         I had the summer in my hair; <br>
         And all the pale gold autumn air <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Was as the habit of my sense. <br>
         My body was as fire that shone; <br>
         God's beauty that makes all things one <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Was one among my handmaidens.<br>
         
         
         
         <center>265<br></center>
         
         CHRYSOTHEMIS. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Samothrace. <br>
         God, making roses, made my face <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As a rose filled up full with red. <br>
         My prows made sharp the straitened seas <br>
         From Pontus to that Chersonese <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whereon the ebbed Asian stream is shed.<br>
         My hair was as sweet scent that drips; <br>
         Love's breath begun about my lips <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Kindled the lips of people dead.<br>
         
         
         
         THOMYRIS. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Scythians. <br>
         My strength was like no strength of man's, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         My face like day, my breast like spring. <br>
         My fame was felt in the extreme land <br>
         That hath sunshine on the one hand <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And on the other star-shining. <br>
         Yea, and the wind there fails of breath; <br>
         Yea, and there life is waste like death; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Yea, and there death is a glad thing.<br>
         
         
         
         HARHAS. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Anakim. <br>
         In the spent years whose speech is dim, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whose raiment is the dust and death, <br>
         My stately body without stain <br>
         Shone as the shining race of rain <br>
         
         <center>266<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whose hair a great wind scattereth. <br>
         Now hath God turned my lips to sighs, <br>
         Plucked off mine eyelids from mine eyes, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And sealed with seals my way of breath.<br>
         
         
         
         MYRRHA. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Arabian. <br>
         The tears wherewith mine eyelids ran <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Smelt like my perfumed eyelids' smell. <br>
         A harsh thirst made my soft mouth hard, <br>
         That ached with kisses afterward; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         My brain rang like a beaten bell.<br>
         As tears on eyes, as fire on wood, <br>
         Sin fed upon my breath and blood, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Sin made my breasts subside and swell.<br>
         
         
         
         PASIPHAE. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Pasiphae. <br>
         Not all the pure clean-coloured sea <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Could cleanse or cool my yearning veins; <br>
         Nor any root nor herb that grew, <br>
         Flag-leaves that let green water through, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Nor washing of the dews and rains. <br>
         From shame's pressed core I wrung the sweet <br>
         Fruit's savour that was death to eat, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whereof no seed but death remains.<br>
         
         
         
         <center>267<br></center>
         
         SAPPHO. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Lesbians. <br>
         My love, that had no part in man's, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Was sweeter than all shape of sweet. <br>
         The intolerable infinite desire <br>
         Made my face pale like faded fire <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         When the ashen pyre falls through with heat. <br>
         My blood was hot wan wine of love, <br>
         And my song's sound the sound thereof, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The sound of the delight of it.<br>
         
         
         
         MESSALINA. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Italy. <br>
         These were the signs God set on me; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         A barren beauty subtle and sleek, <br>
         Curled carven hair, and cheeks worn wan <br>
         With fierce false lips of many a man, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Large temples where the blood ran weak,<br>
         A mouth athirst and amorous <br>
         And hungering as the grave's mouth does <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That, being an-hungred, cannot speak.<br>
         
         
         
         AMESTRIS. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Persians. <br>
         My breasts were lordlier than bright swans, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         My body as amber fair and thin. <br>
         Strange flesh was given my lips for bread, <br>
         With poisonous hours my days were fed, <br>
         
         <center>268<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And my feet shod with adder-skin. <br>
         In Shushan toward Ecbatane <br>
         I wrought my joys with tears and pain, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         My loves with blood and bitter sin.<br>
         
         
         
         EPHRATH. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Rephaim. <br>
         God, that some while refraineth him, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Made in the end a spoil of me. <br>
         My rumour was upon the world <br>
         As strong sound of swoln water hurled <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Through porches of the straining sea. <br>
         My hair was like the flag-flower, <br>
         And my breasts carven goodlier <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Than beryl with chalcedony.<br>
         
         
         
         PASITHEA. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen of Cypriotes. <br>
         Mine oarsmen, labouring with brown throats, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Sang of me many a tender thing. <br>
         My maidens, girdled loose and braced <br>
         With gold from bosom to white waist, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Praised me between their wool-combing.<br>
         All that praise Venus all night long <br>
         With lips like speech and lids like song <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Praised me till song lost heart to sing.<br>
         
         
         
         <center>269<br></center>
         
         ALACIEL. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Alaciel. <br>
         My mouth was like that moist gold cell <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whereout the thickest honey drips. <br>
         Mine eyes were as a grey-green sea; <br>
         The amorous blood that smote on me <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Smote to my feet and finger-tips. <br>
         My throat was whiter than the dove, <br>
         Mine eyelids as the seals of love, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And as the doors of love my lips.<br>
         
         
         
         ERIGONE. 
         <br><br>
         I am the queen Erigone. <br>
         The wild wine shed as blood on me <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Made my face brighter than a bride's. <br>
         My large lips had the old thirst of earth, <br>
         Mine arms the might of the old sea's girth <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Bound round the whole world's iron sides. <br>
         Within mine eyes and in mine ears <br>
         Were music and the wine of tears, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And light, and thunder of the tides. <br>
         
         Et hìc exeant, et dicat Bersabe regina;
         <br><br>
         Alas, God, for thy great pity <br>
         And for the might that is in thee, <br>
         Behold, I woful Bersabe <br>
         Cry out with stoopings of my knee <br>
         And thy wrath laid and bound on me <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Till I may see thy love.<br>
         
         <center>270<br></center>
         Behold, Lord, this child is grown <br>
         Within me between bone and bone <br>
         To make me mother of a son, <br>
         Made of my body with strong moan; <br>
         There shall not be another one <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That shall be made hereof.<br>
         
         
         
         KING DAVID. 
         <br><br>
         Lord God, alas, what shall I sain? <br>
         Lo, thou art as an hundred men <br>
         Both to break and build again: <br>
         The wild ways thou makest plain, <br>
         Thine hands hold the hail and rain, <br>
         And thy fingers both grape and grain; <br>
         Of their largess we be all well fain, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And of their great pity: <br>
         The sun thou madest of good gold, <br>
         Of clean silver the moon cold, <br>
         All the great stars thou hast told <br>
         As thy cattle in thy fold <br>
         Every one by his name of old; <br>
         Wind and water thou hast in hold, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Both the land and the long sea; <br>
         Both the green sea and the land, <br>
         Lord God, thou hast in hand, <br>
         Both white water and grey sand; <br>
         Upon thy right or thy left hand <br>
         There is no man that may stand; <br>
         
         <center>271<br></center>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Lord, thou rue on me. <br>
         O wise Lord, if thou be keen <br>
         To note things amiss that been, <br>
         I am not worth a shell of bean <br>
         More than an old mare meagre and lean;<br>
         For all my wrong-doing with my queen, <br>
         It grew not of our heartès clean, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         But it began of her body. <br>
         For it fell in the hot May <br>
         I stood within a paven way <br>
         Built of fair bright stone, perfay, <br>
         That is as fire of night and day <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And lighteth all my house. <br>
         Therein be neither stones nor sticks, <br>
         Neither red nor white bricks, <br>
         But for cubits five or six <br>
         There is most goodly sardonyx <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And amber laid in rows. <br>
         It goes round about my roofs, <br>
         (If ye list ye shall have proofs) <br>
         There is good space for horse and hoofs, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Plain and nothing perilous. <br>
         For the fair green weather's heat, <br>
         And for the smell of leavès sweet, <br>
         It is no marvel, well ye weet, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         A man to waxen amorous. <br>
         This I say now by my case <br>
         That spied forth of that royal place; <br>
         
         <center>272<br></center>
         There I saw in no great space <br>
         Mine own sweet, both body and face, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Under the fresh boughs. <br>
         In a water that was there <br>
         She wesshe her goodly body bare <br>
         And dried it with her owen hair: <br>
         Both her arms and her knees fair, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Both bosom and brows; <br>
         Both shoulders and eke thighs <br>
         Tho she wesshe upon this wise; <br>
         Ever she sighed with little sighs, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And ever she gave God thank.<br>
         Yea, God wot I can well see yet <br>
         Both her breast and her sides all wet <br>
         And her long hair withouten let <br>
         Spread sideways like a drawing net; <br>
         Full dear bought and full far fet <br>
         Was that sweet thing there y-set; <br>
         It were a hard thing to forget <br>
         How both lips and eyen met, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Breast and breath sank. <br>
         So goodly a sight as there she was, <br>
         Lying looking on her glass <br>
         By wan water in green grass, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Yet saw never man. <br>
         So soft and great she was and bright <br>
         With all her body waxen white, <br>
         I woxe nigh blind to see the light <br>
         
         <center>273<br></center>
         Shed out of it to left and right; <br>
         This bitter sin from that sweet sight <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Between us twain began.<br>
         
         
         
         NATHAN. 
         <br><br>
         Now, sir, be merry anon, <br>
         For ye shall have a full wise son, <br>
         Goodly and great of flesh and bone; <br>
         There shall no king be such an one, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         I swear by Godis rood. <br>
         Therefore, lord, be merry here, <br>
         And go to meat withouten fear, <br>
         And hear a mass with goodly cheer; <br>
         For to all folk ye shall be dear, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And all folk of your blood. <br>

         <h3>ST. DOROTHY</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">It </span>hath been seen and yet it shall be seen <br>
         That out of tender mouths God's praise hath been <br>
         Made perfect, and with wood and simple string <br>
         He hath played music sweet as shawm-playing <br>
         To please himself with softness of all sound; <br>
         And no small thing but hath been sometime found <br>
         Full sweet of use, and no such humbleness <br>
         But God hath bruised withal the sentences <br>
         And evidence of wise men witnessing; <br>
         No leaf that is so soft a hidden thing <br>
         It never shall get sight of the great sun; <br>
         The strength of ten has been the strength of one, <br>
         And lowliness has waxed imperious.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There was in Rome a man Theophilus <br>
         Of right great blood and gracious ways, that had <br>
         All noble fashions to make people glad <br>
         And a soft life of pleasurable days; <br>
         He was a goodly man for one to praise, <br>
         Flawless and whole upward from foot to head; <br>
         His arms were a red hawk that alway fed <br>
         
         <center>275<br></center>
         On a small bird with feathers gnawed upon, <br>
         Beaten and plucked about the bosom-bone <br>
         Whereby a small round fleck like fire there was: <br>
         They called it in their tongue lampadias;<br>
         This was the banner of the lordly man. <br>
         In many straits of sea and reaches wan <br>
         Full of quick wind, and many a shaken firth, <br>
         It had seen fighting days of either earth, <br>
         Westward or east of waters Gaditane <br>
         (This was the place of sea-rocks under Spain <br>
         Called after the great praise of Hercules) <br>
         And north beyond the washing Pontic seas, <br>
         Far windy Russian places fabulous, <br>
         And salt fierce tides of storm-swoln Bosphorus.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Now as this lord came straying in Rome town <br>
         He saw a little lattice open down <br>
         And after it a press of maidens' heads <br>
         That sat upon their cold small quiet beds <br>
         Talking, and played upon short-stringèd lutes; <br>
         And other some ground perfume out of roots <br>
         Gathered by marvellous moons in Asia; <br>
         Saffron and aloes and wild cassia, <br>
         Coloured all through and smelling of the sun; <br>
         And over all these was a certain one <br>
         Clothed softly, with sweet herbs about her hair <br>
         And bosom flowerful; her face more fair <br>
         Than sudden-singing April in soft lands: <br>
         Eyed like a gracious bird, and in both hands <br>
         
         <center>276<br></center>
         She held a psalter painted green and red.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This Theophile laughed at the heart, and said, <br>
         Now God so help me hither and St. Paul, <br>
         As by the new time of their festival <br>
         I have good will to take this maid to wife. <br>
         And herewith fell to fancies of her life <br>
         And soft half-thoughts that ended suddenly. <br>
         This is man's guise to please himself, when he <br>
         Shall not see one thing of his pleasant things, <br>
         Nor with outwatch of many travailings<br>
         Come to be eased of the least pain he hath <br>
         For all his love and all his foolish wrath <br>
         And all the heavy manner of his mind. <br>
         Thus is he like a fisher fallen blind <br>
         That casts his nets across the boat awry <br>
         To strike the sea, but lo, he striketh dry <br>
         And plucks them back all broken for his pain <br>
         And bites his beard and casts across again <br>
         And reaching wrong slips over in the sea. <br>
         So hath this man a strangled neck for fee, <br>
         For all his cost he chuckles in his throat.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This Theophile that little hereof wote <br>
         Laid wait to hear of her what she might be: <br>
         Men told him she had name of Dorothy, <br>
         And was a lady of a worthy house. <br>
         Thereat this knight grew inly glorious <br>
         That he should have a love so fair of place. <br>
         She was a maiden of most quiet face, <br>
         
         <center>277<br></center>
         Tender of speech, and had no hardihood <br>
         But was nigh feeble of her fearful blood; <br>
         Her mercy in her was so marvellous <br>
         From her least years, that seeing her school-fellows <br>
         That read beside her stricken with a rod, <br>
         She would cry sore and say some word to God <br>
         That he would ease her fellow of his pain. <br>
         There is no touch of sun or fallen rain <br>
         That ever fell on a more gracious thing.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In middle Rome there was in stone-working <br>
         The church of Venus painted royally. <br>
         The chapels of it were some two or three, <br>
         In each of them her tabernacle was <br>
         And a wide window of six feet in glass <br>
         Coloured with all her works in red and gold. <br>
         The altars had bright cloths and cups to hold<br>
         The wine of Venus for the services, <br>
         Made out of honey and crushed wood-berries <br>
         That shed sweet yellow through the thick wet red, <br>
         That on high days was borne upon the head <br>
         Of Venus' priest for any man to drink; <br>
         So that in drinking he should fall to think <br>
         On some fair face, and in the thought thereof <br>
         Worship, and such should triumph in his love. <br>
         For this soft wine that did such grace and good <br>
         Was new trans-shaped and mixed with Love's own blood, <br>
         That in the fighting Trojan time was bled; <br>
         For which came such a woe to Diomed <br>
         
         <center>278<br></center>
         That he was stifled after in hard sea. <br>
         And some said that this wine-shedding should be <br>
         Made of the falling of Adonis' blood, <br>
         That curled upon the thorns and broken wood <br>
         And round the gold silk shoes on Venus' feet; <br>
         The taste thereof was as hot honey sweet, <br>
         And in the mouth ran soft and riotous. <br>
         This was the holiness of Venus' house.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         It was their worship, that in August days <br>
         Twelve maidens should go through those Roman ways <br>
         Naked, and having gold across their brows <br>
         And their hair twisted in short golden rows, <br>
         To minister to Venus in this wise: <br>
         And twelve men chosen in their companies <br>
         To match these maidens by the altar-stair, <br>
         All in one habit, crowned upon the hair. <br>
         Among these men was chosen Theophile.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This knight went out and prayed a little while, <br>
         Holding queen Venus by her hands and knees; <br>
         I will give thee twelve royal images<br>
         Cut in glad gold, with marvels of wrought stone <br>
         For thy sweet priests to lean and pray upon, <br>
         Jasper and hyacinth and chrysopras, <br>
         And the strange Asian thalamite that was <br>
         Hidden twelve ages under heavy sea <br>
         Among the little sleepy pearls, to be <br>
         A shrine lit over with soft candle-flame <br>
         Burning all night red as hot brows of shame, <br>
         
         <center>279<br></center>
         So thou wilt be my lady without sin. <br>
         Goddess that art all gold outside and in, <br>
         Help me to serve thee in thy holy way. <br>
         Thou knowest, Love, that in my bearing day <br>
         There shone a laughter in the singing stars <br>
         Round the gold-ceilèd bride-bed wherein Mars <br>
         Touched thee and had thee in your kissing wise. <br>
         Now therefore, sweet, kiss thou my maiden's eyes <br>
         That they may open graciously towards me; <br>
         And this new fashion of thy shrine shall be <br>
         As soft with gold as thine own happy head.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The goddess, that was painted with face red <br>
         Between two long green tumbled sides of sea, <br>
         Stooped her neck sideways, and spake pleasantly: <br>
         Thou shalt have grace as thou art thrall of mine. <br>
         And with this came a savour of shed wine <br>
         And plucked-out petals from a rose's head: <br>
         And softly with slow laughs of lip she said, <br>
         Thou shalt have favour all thy days of me.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then came Theophilus to Dorothy, <br>
         Saying: O sweet, if one should strive or speak <br>
         Against God's ways, he gets a beaten cheek <br>
         For all his wage and shame above all men. <br>
         Therefore I have no will to turn again <br>
         When God saith ``go,'' lest a worse thing fall out. <br>
         Then she, misdoubting lest he went about<br>
         To catch her wits, made answer somewhat thus: <br>
         I have no will, my lord Theophilus, <br>
         
         <center>280<br></center>
         To speak against this worthy word of yours; <br>
         Knowing how God's will in all speech endures, <br>
         That save by grace there may no thing be said. <br>
         Then Theophile waxed light from foot to head, <br>
         And softly fell upon this answering. <br>
         It is well seen you are a chosen thing <br>
         To do God service in his gracious way. <br>
         I will that you make haste and holiday <br>
         To go next year upon the Venus stair, <br>
         Covered none else, but crowned upon your hair, <br>
         And do the service that a maiden doth. <br>
         She said: but I that am Christ's maid were loth <br>
         To do this thing that hath such bitter name. <br>
         Thereat his brows were beaten with sore shame <br>
         And he came off and said no other word. <br>
         Then his eyes chanced upon his banner-bird, <br>
         And he fell fingering at the staff of it <br>
         And laughed for wrath and stared between his feet, <br>
         And out of a chafed heart he spake as thus: <br>
         Lo how she japes at me Theophilus, <br>
         Feigning herself a fool and hard to love; <br>
         Yet in good time for all she boasteth of <br>
         She shall be like a little beaten bird. <br>
         And while his mouth was open in that word <br>
         He came upon the house Janiculum, <br>
         Where some went busily, and other some <br>
         Talked in the gate called the gate glorious. <br>
         The emperor, which was one Gabalus, <br>
         
         <center>281<br></center>
         Sat over all and drank chill wine alone. <br>
         To whom is come Theophilus anon, <br>
         And said as thus: <i>Beau sire, Dieu vous aide</i>. <br>
         And afterward sat under him, and said<br>
         All this thing through as ye have wholly heard.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This Gabalus laughed thickly in his beard. <br>
         Yea, this is righteousness and maiden rule. <br>
         Truly, he said, a maid is but a fool. <br>
         And japed at them as one full villainous, <br>
         In a lewd wise, this heathen Gabalus, <br>
         And sent his men to bind her as he bade. <br>
         Thus have they taken Dorothy the maid, <br>
         And haled her forth as men hale pick-purses: <br>
         A little need God knows they had of this, <br>
         To hale her by her maiden gentle hair. <br>
         Thus went she lowly, making a soft prayer, <br>
         As one who stays the sweet wine in his mouth, <br>
         Murmuring with eased lips, and is most loth <br>
         To have done wholly with the sweet of it.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Christ king, fair Christ, that knowest all men's wit <br>
         And all the feeble fashion of my ways, <br>
         O perfect God, that from all yesterdays <br>
         Abidest whole with morrows perfected, <br>
         I pray thee by thy mother's holy head <br>
         Thou help me to do right, that I not slip: <br>
         I have no speech nor strength upon my lip, <br>
         Except thou help me who art wise and sweet. <br>
         Do this too for those nails that clove thy feet, <br>
         
         <center>282<br></center>
         Let me die maiden after many pains. <br>
         Though I be least among thy handmaidens, <br>
         Doubtless I shall take death more sweetly thus.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Now have they brought her to King Gabalus, <br>
         Who laughed in all his throat some breathing-whiles: <br>
         By God, he said, if one should leap two miles, <br>
         He were not pained about the sides so much. <br>
         This were a soft thing for a man to touch.<br>
         Shall one so chafe that hath such little bones? <br>
         And shook his throat with thick and chuckled moans <br>
         For laughter that she had such holiness. <br>
         What aileth thee, wilt thou do services? <br>
         It were good fare to fare as Venus doth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then said this lady with her maiden mouth, <br>
         Shamefaced, and something paler in the cheek: <br>
         Now, sir, albeit my wit and will to speak <br>
         Give me no grace in sight of worthy men, <br>
         For all my shame yet know I this again, <br>
         I may not speak, nor after downlying <br>
         Rise up to take delight in lute-playing, <br>
         Nor sing nor sleep, nor sit and fold my hands, <br>
         But my soul in some measure understands <br>
         God's grace laid like a garment over me. <br>
         For this fair God that out of strong sharp sea <br>
         Lifted the shapely and green-coloured land, <br>
         And hath the weight of heaven in his hand <br>
         As one might hold a bird, and under him <br>
         The heavy golden planets beam by beam <br>
         
         <center>283<br></center>
         Building the feasting-chambers of his house, <br>
         And the large world he holdeth with his brows <br>
         And with the light of them astonisheth <br>
         All place and time and face of life and death <br>
         And motion of the north wind and the south, <br>
         And is the sound within his angel's mouth <br>
         Of singing words and words of thanksgiving, <br>
         And is the colour of the latter spring <br>
         And heat upon the summer and the sun, <br>
         And is beginning of all things begun <br>
         And gathers in him all things to their end, <br>
         And with the fingers of his hand doth bend <br>
         The stretched-out sides of heaven like a sail, <br>
         And with his breath he maketh the red pale<br>
         And fills with blood faint faces of men dead, <br>
         And with the sound between his lips are fed <br>
         Iron and fire and the white body of snow, <br>
         And blossom of all trees in places low, <br>
         And small bright herbs about the little hills, <br>
         And fruit pricked softly with birds' tender bills, <br>
         And flight of foam about green fields of sea, <br>
         And fourfold strength of the great winds that be <br>
         Moved always outward from beneath his feet, <br>
         And growth of grass and growth of sheavèd wheat <br>
         And all green flower of goodly-growing lands; <br>
         And all these things he gathers with his hands <br>
         And covers all their beauty with his wings; <br>
         The same, even God that governs all these things, <br>
         
         <center>284<br></center>
         Hath set my feet to be upon his ways. <br>
         Now therefore for no painfulness of days <br>
         I shall put off this service bound on me. <br>
         Also, fair sir, ye know this certainly, <br>
         How God was in his flesh full chaste and meek <br>
         And gave his face to shame, and either cheek <br>
         Gave up to smiting of men tyrannous.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And here with a great voice this Gabalus <br>
         Cried out and said: By God's blood and his bones, <br>
         This were good game betwixen night and nones <br>
         For one to sit and hearken to such saws: <br>
         I were as lief fall in some big beast's jaws <br>
         As hear these women's jaw-teeth chattering; <br>
         By God a woman is the harder thing, <br>
         One may not put a hook into her mouth. <br>
         Now by St. Luke I am so sore adrouth <br>
         For all these saws I must needs drink again. <br>
         But I pray God deliver all us men <br>
         From all such noise of women and their heat. <br>
         That is a noble scripture, well I weet,<br>
         That likens women to an empty can; <br>
         When God said that he was a full wise man. <br>
         I trow no man may blame him as for that.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And herewithal he drank a draught, and spat, <br>
         And said: Now shall I make an end hereof. <br>
         Come near all men and hearken for God's love, <br>
         And ye shall hear a jest or twain, God wot. <br>
         And spake as thus with mouth full thick and hot; <br>
         
         <center>285<br></center>
         But thou do this thou shalt be shortly slain. <br>
         Lo, sir, she said, this death and all his pain <br>
         I take in penance of my bitter sins. <br>
         Yea now, quoth Gabalus, this game begins. <br>
         Lo, without sin one shall not live a span. <br>
         Lo, this is she that would not look on man <br>
         Between her fingers folded in thwart wise. <br>
         See how her shame hath smitten in her eyes <br>
         That was so clean she had not heard of shame. <br>
         Certes, he said, by Gabalus my name, <br>
         This two years back I was not so well pleased. <br>
         This were good mirth for sick men to be eased <br>
         And rise up whole and laugh at hearing of. <br>
         I pray thee show us something of thy love, <br>
         Since thou wast maid thy gown is waxen wide. <br>
         Yea, maid I am, she said, and somewhat sighed, <br>
         As one who thought upon the low fair house <br>
         Where she sat working, with soft bended brows <br>
         Watching her threads, among the school-maidens. <br>
         And she thought well now God had brought her thence <br>
         She should not come to sew her gold again.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then cried King Gabalus upon his men <br>
         To have her forth and draw her with steel gins. <br>
         And as a man hag-ridden beats and grins <br>
         And bends his body sidelong in his bed, <br>
         So wagged he with his body and knave's head,<br>
         Gaping at her, and blowing with his breath. <br>
         And in good time he gat an evil death <br>
         
         <center>286<br></center>
         Out of his lewdness with his cursèd wives: <br>
         His bones were hewn asunder as with knives <br>
         For his misliving, certes it is said. <br>
         But all the evil wrought upon this maid, <br>
         It were full hard for one to handle it. <br>
         For her soft blood was shed upon her feet, <br>
         And all her body's colour bruised and faint. <br>
         But she, as one abiding God's great saint, <br>
         Spake not nor wept for all this travail hard. <br>
         Wherefore the king commanded afterward <br>
         To slay her presently in all men's sight. <br>
         And it was now an hour upon the night <br>
         And winter-time, and a few stars began. <br>
         The weather was yet feeble and all wan <br>
         For beating of a weighty wind and snow. <br>
         And she came walking in soft wise and slow, <br>
         And many men with faces piteous. <br>
         Then came this heavy cursing Gabalus, <br>
         That swore full hard into his drunken beard; <br>
         And faintly after without any word <br>
         Came Theophile some paces off the king. <br>
         And in the middle of this wayfaring <br>
         Full tenderly beholding her he said:<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There is no word of comfort with men dead <br>
         Nor any face and colour of things sweet; <br>
         But always with lean cheeks and lifted feet <br>
         These dead men lie all aching to the blood <br>
         With bitter cold, their brows withouten hood <br>
         
         <center>287<br></center>
         Beating for chill, their bodies swathed full thin: <br>
         Alas, what hire shall any have herein <br>
         To give his life and get such bitterness? <br>
         Also the soul going forth bodiless<br>
         Is hurt with naked cold, and no man saith <br>
         If there be house or covering for death <br>
         To hide the soul that is discomforted.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then she beholding him a little said: <br>
         Alas, fair lord, ye have no wit of this; <br>
         For on one side death is full poor of bliss <br>
         And as ye say full sharp of bone and lean: <br>
         But on the other side is good and green <br>
         And hath soft flower of tender-coloured hair <br>
         Grown on his head, and a red mouth as fair <br>
         As may be kissed with lips; thereto his face <br>
         Is as God's face, and in a perfect place <br>
         Full of all sun and colour of straight boughs <br>
         And waterheads about a painted house <br>
         That hath a mile of flowers either way <br>
         Outward from it, and blossom-grass of May <br>
         Thickening on many a side for length of heat, <br>
         Hath God set death upon a noble seat <br>
         Covered with green and flowered in the fold, <br>
         In likeness of a great king grown full old <br>
         And gentle with new temperance of blood; <br>
         And on his brows a purfled purple hood, <br>
         They may not carry any golden thing; <br>
         And plays some tune with subtle fingering <br>
         
         <center>288<br></center>
         On a small cithern, full of tears and sleep <br>
         And heavy pleasure that is quick to weep <br>
         And sorrow with the honey in her mouth; <br>
         And for this might of music that he doth <br>
         Are all souls drawn toward him with great love <br>
         And weep for sweetness of the noise thereof <br>
         And bow to him with worship of their knees; <br>
         And all the field is thick with companies <br>
         Of fair-clothed men that play on shawms and lutes <br>
         And gather honey of the yellow fruits<br>
         Between the branches waxen soft and wide: <br>
         And all this peace endures in either side <br>
         Of the green land, and God beholdeth all. <br>
         And this is girdled with a round fair wall <br>
         Made of red stone and cool with heavy leaves <br>
         Grown out against it, and green blossom cleaves <br>
         To the green chinks, and lesser wall-weed sweet, <br>
         Kissing the crannies that are split with heat, <br>
         And branches where the summer draws to head.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And Theophile burnt in the cheek, and said: <br>
         Yea, could one see it, this were marvellous. <br>
         I pray you, at your coming to this house, <br>
         Give me some leaf of all those tree-branches; <br>
         Seeing how so sharp and white our weather is, <br>
         There is no green nor gracious red to see.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yea, sir, she said, that shall I certainly. <br>
         And from her long sweet throat without a fleck <br>
         Undid the gold, and through her stretched-out neck <br>
         
         <center>289<br></center>
         The cold axe clove, and smote away her head. <br>
         Out of her throat the tender blood full red <br>
         Fell suddenly through all her long soft hair. <br>
         And with good speed for hardness of the air <br>
         Each man departed to his house again.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Lo, as fair colour in the face of men <br>
         At seed-time of their blood, or in such wise <br>
         As a thing seen increaseth in men's eyes, <br>
         Caught first far off by sickly fits of sight— <br>
         So a word said, if one shall hear aright, <br>
         Abides against the season of its growth. <br>
         This Theophile went slowly as one doth <br>
         That is not sure for sickness of his feet; <br>
         And counting the white stonework of the street, <br>
         Tears fell out of his eyes for wrath and love, <br>
         Making him weep more for the shame thereof<br>
         Than for true pain: so went he half a mile. <br>
         And women mocked him, saying: Theophile, <br>
         Lo, she is dead; what shall a woman have <br>
         That loveth such an one? so Christ me save, <br>
         I were as lief to love a man new-hung. <br>
         Surely this man has bitten on his tongue, <br>
         This makes him sad and writhled in his face.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And when they came upon the paven place <br>
         That was called sometime the place amorous, <br>
         There came a child before Theophilus <br>
         Bearing a basket, and said suddenly: <br>
         Fair sir, this is my mistress Dorothy <br>
         
         <center>290<br></center>
         That sends you gifts; and with this he was gone. <br>
         In all this earth there is not such an one <br>
         For colour and straight stature made so fair. <br>
         The tender growing gold of his pure hair <br>
         Was as wheat growing, and his mouth as flame. <br>
         God called him Holy after his own name; <br>
         With gold cloth like fire burning he was clad. <br>
         But for the fair green basket that he had, <br>
         It was filled up with heavy white and red; <br>
         Great roses stained still where the first rose bled, <br>
         Burning at heart for shame their heart withholds: <br>
         And the sad colour of strong marigolds <br>
         That have the sun to kiss their lips for love; <br>
         The flower that Venus' hair is woven of, <br>
         The colour of fair apples in the sun, <br>
         Late peaches gathered when the heat was done <br>
         And the slain air got breath; and after these <br>
         The fair faint-headed poppies drunk with ease, <br>
         And heaviness of hollow lilies red.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then cried they all that saw these things, and said <br>
         It was God's doing, and was marvellous. <br>
         And in brief while this knight Theophilus<br>
         Is waxen full of faith, and witnesseth <br>
         Before the king of God and love and death, <br>
         For which the king bade hang him presently. <br>
         A gallows of a goodly piece of tree <br>
         This Gabalus hath made to hang him on. <br>
         Forth of this world lo Theophile is gone <br>
         
         <center>291<br></center>
         With a wried neck, God give us better fare <br>
         Than his that hath a twisted throat to wear; <br>
         But truly for his love God hath him brought <br>
         There where his heavy body grieves him nought <br>
         Nor all the people plucking at his feet; <br>
         But in his face his lady's face is sweet, <br>
         And through his lips her kissing lips are gone: <br>
         God send him peace, and joy of such an one.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This is the story of St. Dorothy. <br>
         I will you of your mercy pray for me <br>
         Because I wrote these sayings for your grace, <br>
         That I may one day see her in the face.<br>

         <h3>THE TWO DREAMS.</h3>
         
         <h3>(FROM BOCCACCIO).</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">I will</span> that if I say a heavy thing <br>
         Your tongues forgive me; seeing ye know that spring <br>
         Has flecks and fits of pain to keep her sweet, <br>
         And walks somewhile with winter-bitten feet. <br>
         Moreover it sounds often well to let <br>
         One string, when ye play music, keep at fret <br>
         The whole song through; one petal that is dead <br>
         Confirms the roses, be they white or red; <br>
         Dead sorrow is not sorrowful to hear <br>
         As the thick noise that breaks mid weeping were; <br>
         The sick sound aching in a lifted throat <br>
         Turns to sharp silver of a perfect note; <br>
         And though the rain falls often, and with rain <br>
         Late autumn falls on the old red leaves like pain, <br>
         I deem that God is not disquieted. <br>
         Also while men are fed with wine and bread, <br>
         They shall be fed with sorrow at his hand.<br>
         
         <br><br>

         There grew a rose-garden in Florence land <br>
         More fair than many; all red summers through <br>
         The leaves smelt sweet and sharp of rain, and blew <br>
         
         <center>293<br></center>
         Sideways with tender wind; and therein fell <br>
         Sweet sound wherewith the green waxed audible,<br>
         As a bird's will to sing disturbed his throat <br>
         And set the sharp wings forward like a boat <br>
         Pushed through soft water, moving his brown side <br>
         Smooth-shapen as a maid's, and shook with pride <br>
         His deep warm bosom, till the heavy sun's <br>
         Set face of heat stopped all the songs at once. <br>
         The ways were clean to walk and delicate; <br>
         And when the windy white of March grew late, <br>
         Before the trees took heart to face the sun <br>
         With ravelled raiment of lean winter on, <br>
         The roots were thick and hot with hollow grass.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Some roods away a lordly house there was, <br>
         Cool with broad courts and latticed passage wet <br>
         From rush-flowers and lilies ripe to set, <br>
         Sown close among the strewings of the floor; <br>
         And either wall of the slow corridor <br>
         Was dim with deep device of gracious things; <br>
         Some angel's steady mouth and weight of wings <br>
         Shut to the side; or Peter with straight stole <br>
         And beard cut black against the aureole <br>
         That spanned his head from nape to crown; thereby <br>
         Mary's gold hair, thick to the girdle-tie <br>
         Wherein was bound a child with tender feet; <br>
         Or the broad cross with blood nigh brown on it.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Within this house a righteous lord abode <br>
         Ser Averardo; patient of his mood, <br>
         
         <center>294<br></center>
         And just of judgment; and to child he had <br>
         A maid so sweet that her mere sight made glad <br>
         Men sorrowing, and unbound the brows of hate; <br>
         And where she came, the lips that pain made strait <br>
         Waxed warm and wide, and from untender grew <br>
         Tender as those that sleep brings patience to. <br>
         Such long locks had she, that with knee to chin <br>
         She might have wrapped and warmed her feet therein.<br>
         Right seldom fell her face on weeping wise; <br>
         Gold hair she had, and golden-coloured eyes, <br>
         Filled with clear light and fire and large repose <br>
         Like a fair hound's; no man there is but knows <br>
         Her face was white, and thereto she was tall; <br>
         In no wise lacked there any praise at all <br>
         To her most perfect and pure maidenhood; <br>
         No sin I think there was in all her blood.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         She, where a gold grate shut the roses in, <br>
         Dwelt daily through deep summer weeks, through green <br>
         Hushed hours of rain upon the leaves; and there <br>
         Love made him room and space to worship her <br>
         With tender worship of bowed knees, and wrought <br>
         Such pleasure as the pained sense palates not <br>
         For weariness, but at one taste undoes <br>
         The heart of its strong sweet, is ravenous <br>
         Of all the hidden honey; words and sense <br>
         Fail through the tune's imperious prevalence.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In a poor house this lover kept apart, <br>
         Long communing with patience next his heart <br>
         
         <center>295<br></center>
         If love of his might move that face at all, <br>
         Tuned evenwise with colours musical; <br>
         Then after length of days he said thus: "Love, <br>
         For love's own sake and for the love thereof <br>
         Let no harsh words untune your gracious mood; <br>
         For good it were, if anything be good, <br>
         To comfort me in this pain's plague of mine; <br>
         Seeing thus, how neither sleep nor bread nor wine <br>
         Seems pleasant to me, yea no thing that is <br>
         Seems pleasant to me; only I know this; <br>
         Love's ways are sharp for palms of piteous feet <br>
         To travel, but the end of such is sweet:<br>
         Now do with me as seemeth you the best." <br>
         She mused a little, as one holds his guest <br>
         By the hand musing, with her face borne down: <br>
         Then said: "Yea, though such bitter seed be sown, <br>
         Have no more care of all that you have said; <br>
         Since if there is no sleep will bind your head, <br>
         Lo, I am fain to help you certainly; <br>
         Christ knoweth, sir, if I would have you die; <br>
         There is no pleasure when a man is dead." <br>
         Thereat he kissed her hands and yellow head <br>
         And clipped her fair long body many times; <br>
         I have no wit to shape in written rhymes <br>
         A scanted tithe of this great joy they had.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         They were too near love's secret to be glad; <br>
         As whoso deems the core will surely melt <br>
         From the warm fruit his lips caress, hath felt <br>
         
         <center>296<br></center>
         Some bitter kernel where the teeth shut hard: <br>
         Or as sweet music sharpens afterward, <br>
         Being half disrelished both for sharp and sweet; <br>
         As sea-water, having killed over-heat <br>
         In a man's body, chills it with faint ache; <br>
         So their sense, burdened only for love's sake, <br>
         Failed for pure love; yet so time served their wit, <br>
         They saved each day some gold reserves of it, <br>
         Being wiser in love's riddle than such be <br>
         Whom fragments feed with his chance charity. <br>
         All things felt sweet were felt sweet overmuch; <br>
         The rose-thorn's prickle dangerous to touch, <br>
         And flecks of fire in the thin leaf-shadows; <br>
         Too keen the breathèd honey of the rose, <br>
         Its red too harsh a weight on feasted eyes; <br>
         They were so far gone in love's histories, <br>
         Beyond all shape and colour and mere breath, <br>
         Where pleasure has for kinsfolk sleep and death,<br>
         And strength of soul and body waxen blind <br>
         For weariness, and flesh entoiled with mind, <br>
         When the keen edge of sense foretasteth sin.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Even this green place the summer caught them in <br>
         Seemed half deflowered and sick with beaten leaves <br>
         In their strayed eyes; these gold flower-fumèd eves <br>
         Burnt out to make the sun's love-offering, <br>
         The midnoon's prayer, the rose's thanksgiving, <br>
         The trees' weight burdening the strengthless air, <br>
         The shape of her stilled eyes, her coloured hair, <br>
         
         <center>297<br></center>
         Her body's balance from the moving feet— <br>
         All this, found fair, lacked yet one grain of sweet <br>
         It had some warm weeks back: so perisheth <br>
         On May's new lip the tender April breath: <br>
         So those same walks the wind sowed lilies in <br>
         All April through, and all their latter kin <br>
         Of languid leaves whereon the autumn blows— <br>
         The dead red raiment of the last year's rose— <br>
         The last year's laurel, and the last year's love, <br>
         Fade, and grow things that death grows weary of.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         What man will gather in red summer-time <br>
         The fruit of some obscure and hoary rhyme <br>
         Heard last midwinter, taste the heart in it, <br>
         Mould the smooth semitones afresh, refit <br>
         The fair limbs ruined, flush the dead blood through <br>
         With colour, make all broken beauties new <br>
         For love's new lesson—shall not such find pain <br>
         When the marred music labouring in his brain <br>
         Frets him with sweet sharp fragments, and lets slip <br>
         One word that might leave satisfied his lip— <br>
         One touch that might put fire in all the chords? <br>
         This was her pain: to miss from all sweet words <br>
         Some taste of sound, diverse and delicate— <br>
         Some speech the old love found out to compensate<br>
         For seasons of shut lips and drowsiness— <br>
         Some grace, some word the old love found out to bless <br>
         Passionless months and undelighted weeks. <br>
         The flowers had lost their summer-scented cheeks, <br>
         
         <center>298<br></center>
         Their lips were no more sweet than daily breath: <br>
         The year was plagued with instances of death.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         So fell it, these were sitting in cool grass <br>
         With leaves about, and many a bird there was <br>
         Where the green shadow thickliest impleached <br>
         Soft fruit and writhen spray and blossom bleached <br>
         Dry in the sun or washed with rains to white: <br>
         Her girdle was pure silk, the bosom bright <br>
         With purple as purple water and gold wrought in. <br>
         One branch had touched with dusk her lips and chin, <br>
         Made violet of the throat, abashed with shade <br>
         The breast's bright plaited work: but nothing frayed <br>
         The sun's large kiss on the luxurious hair. <br>
         Her beauty was new colour to the air <br>
         And music to the silent many birds. <br>
         Love was an-hungred for some perfect words <br>
         To praise her with; but only her low name <br>
         "Andrevuola" came thrice, and thrice put shame <br>
         In her clear cheek, so fruitful with new red <br>
         That for pure love straightway shame's self was dead.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Then with lids gathered as who late had wept <br>
         She began saying: "I have so little slept <br>
         My lids drowse now against the very sun; <br>
         Yea, the brain aching with a dream begun <br>
         Beats like a fitful blood; kiss but both brows, <br>
         And you shall pluck my thoughts grown dangerous <br>
         Almost away." He said thus, kissing them: <br>
         "O sole sweet thing that God is glad to name, <br>
         
         <center>299<br></center>
         My one gold gift, if dreams be sharp and sore <br>
         Shall not the waking time increase much more<br>
         With taste and sound, sweet eyesight or sweet scent? <br>
         Has any heat too hard and insolent <br>
         Burnt bare the tender married leaves, undone <br>
         The maiden grass shut under from the sun? <br>
         Where in this world is room enough for pain?"<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The feverish finger of love had touched again <br>
         Her lips with happier blood; the pain lay meek <br>
         In her fair face, nor altered lip nor cheek <br>
         With pallor or with pulse; but in her mouth <br>
         Love thirsted as a man wayfaring doth, <br>
         Making it humble as weak hunger is. <br>
         She lay close to him, bade do this and this, <br>
         Say that, sing thus: then almost weeping-ripe <br>
         Crouched, then laughed low. As one that fain would wipe <br>
         The old record out of old things done and dead, <br>
         She rose, she heaved her hands up, and waxed red <br>
         For wilful heart and blameless fear of blame; <br>
         Saying "Though my wits be weak, this is no shame <br>
         For a poor maid whom love so punisheth <br>
         With heats of hesitation and stopped breath <br>
         That with my dreams I live yet heavily <br>
         For pure sad heart and faith's humility. <br>
         Now be not wroth and I will show you this.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         "Methought our lips upon their second kiss <br>
         Met in this place, and a fair day we had <br>
         And fair soft leaves that waxed and were not sad <br>
         
         <center>300<br></center>
         With shaken rain or bitten through with drouth; <br>
         When I, beholding ever how your mouth <br>
         Waited for mine, the throat being fallen back, <br>
         Saw crawl thereout a live thing flaked with black <br>
         Specks of brute slime and leper-coloured scale, <br>
         A devil's hide with foul flame-writhen grail<br>
         Fashioned where hell's heat festers loathsomest; <br>
         And that brief speech may ease me of the rest, <br>
         Thus were you slain and eaten of the thing. <br>
         My waked eyes felt the new day shuddering <br>
         On their low lids, felt the whole east so beat, <br>
         Pant with close pulse of such a plague-struck heat, <br>
         As if the palpitating dawn drew breath <br>
         For horror, breathing between life and death, <br>
         Till the sun sprang blood-bright and violent."<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         So finishing, her soft strength wholly spent, <br>
         She gazed each way, lest some brute-hoovèd thing, <br>
         The timeless travail of hell's childbearing, <br>
         Should threat upon the sudden: whereat he, <br>
         For relish of her tasted misery <br>
         And tender little thornprick of her pain, <br>
         Laughed with mere love. What lover among men <br>
         But hath his sense fed sovereignly 'twixt whiles <br>
         With tears and covered eyelids and sick smiles <br>
         And soft disaster of a painèd face? <br>
         What pain, established in so sweet a place, <br>
         But the plucked leaf of it smells fragrantly? <br>
         What colour burning man's wide-open eye <br>
         
         <center>301<br></center>
         But may be pleasurably seen? what sense <br>
         Keeps in its hot sharp extreme violence <br>
         No savour of sweet things? The bereaved blood <br>
         And emptied flesh in their most broken mood <br>
         Fail not so wholly, famish not when thus <br>
         Past honey keeps the starved lip covetous.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Therefore this speech from a glad mouth began, <br>
         Breathed in her tender hair and temples wan <br>
         Like one prolonged kiss while the lips had breath: <br>
         "Sleep, that abides in vassalage of death <br>
         And in death's service wears out half his age, <br>
         Hath his dreams full of deadly vassalage,<br>
         Shadow and sound of things ungracious; <br>
         Fair shallow faces, hooded bloodless brows, <br>
         And mouths past kissing; yea, myself have had <br>
         As harsh a dream as holds your eyelids sad.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         "This dream I tell you came three nights ago: <br>
         In full mid sleep I took a whim to know <br>
         How sweet things might be; so I turned and thought; <br>
         But save my dream all sweet availed me not. <br>
         First came a smell of pounded spice and scent <br>
         Such as God ripens in some continent <br>
         Of utmost amber in the Syrian sea; <br>
         And breaths as though some costly rose could be <br>
         Spoiled slowly, wasted by some bitter fire <br>
         To burn the sweet out leaf by leaf, and tire <br>
         The flower's poor heart with heat and waste, to make <br>
         Strong magic for some perfumed woman's sake. <br>
         
         <center>302<br></center>
         Then a cool naked sense beneath my feet <br>
         Of bud and blossom; and sound of veins that beat <br>
         As if a lute should play of its own heart <br>
         And fearfully, not smitten of either part; <br>
         And all my blood it filled with sharp and sweet <br>
         As gold swoln grain fills out the huskèd wheat; <br>
         So I rose naked from the bed, and stood <br>
         Counting the mobile measure in my blood <br>
         Some pleasant while, and through each limb there came <br>
         Swift little pleasures pungent as a flame, <br>
         Felt in the thrilling flesh and veins as much <br>
         As the outer curls that feel the comb's first touch <br>
         Thrill to the roots and shiver as from fire; <br>
         And blind between my dream and my desire <br>
         I seemed to stand and held my spirit still <br>
         Lest this should cease. A child whose fingers spill<br>
         Honey from cells forgotten of the bee <br>
         Is less afraid to stir the hive and see <br>
         Some wasp's bright back inside, than I to feel <br>
         Some finger-touch disturb the flesh like steel. <br>
         I prayed thus; Let me catch a secret here <br>
         So sweet, it sharpens the sweet taste of fear <br>
         And takes the mouth with edge of wine; I would <br>
         Have here some colour and smooth shape as good <br>
         As those in heaven whom the chief garden hides <br>
         With low grape-blossom veiling their white sides <br>
         And lesser tendrils that so bind and blind <br>
         Their eyes and feet, that if one come behind <br>
         
         <center>303<br></center>
         To touch their hair they see not, neither fly; <br>
         This would I see in heaven and not die. <br>
         So praying, I had nigh cried out and knelt, <br>
         So wholly my prayer filled me: till I felt <br>
         In the dumb night's warm weight of glowing gloom <br>
         Somewhat that altered all my sleeping-room, <br>
         And made it like a green low place wherein <br>
         Maids mix to bathe: one sets her small warm chin <br>
         Against a ripple, that the angry pearl <br>
         May flow like flame about her: the next curl <br>
         Dips in some eddy coloured of the sun <br>
         To wash the dust well out; another one <br>
         Holds a straight ankle in her hand and swings <br>
         With lavish body sidelong, so that rings <br>
         Of sweet fierce water, swollen and splendid, fail <br>
         All round her fine and floated body pale, <br>
         Swayed flower-fashion, and her balanced side <br>
         Swerved edgeways lets the weight of water slide, <br>
         As taken in some underflow of sea <br>
         Swerves the banked gold of sea-flowers; but she <br>
         Pulls down some branch to keep her perfect head <br>
         Clear of the river: even from wall to bed,<br>
         I tell you, was my room transfigured so. <br>
         Sweet, green and warm it was, nor could one know <br>
         If there were walls or leaves, or if there was <br>
         No bed's green curtain, but mere gentle grass. <br>
         There were set also hard against the feet <br>
         Gold plates with honey and green grapes to eat, <br>
         
         <center>304<br></center>
         With the cool water's noise to hear in rhymes: <br>
         And a wind warmed me full of furze and limes <br>
         And all hot sweets the heavy summer fills <br>
         To the round brim of smooth cup-shapen hills. <br>
         Next the grave walking of a woman's feet <br>
         Made my veins hesitate, and gracious heat <br>
         Made thick the lids and leaden on mine eyes: <br>
         And I thought ever, surely it were wise <br>
         Not yet to see her: this may last (who knows?) <br>
         Five minutes; the poor rose is twice a rose <br>
         Because it turns a face to her, the wind <br>
         Sings that way; hath this woman ever sinned, <br>
         I wonder? as a boy with apple-rind, <br>
         I played with pleasures, made them to my mind, <br>
         Changed each ere tasting. When she came indeed, <br>
         First her hair touched me, then I grew to feed <br>
         On the sense of her hand; her mouth at last <br>
         Touched me between the cheek and lip and past <br>
         Over my face with kisses here and there <br>
         Sown in and out across the eyes and hair. <br>
         Still I said nothing; till she set her face <br>
         More close and harder on the kissing-place, <br>
         And her mouth caught like a snake's mouth, and stung <br>
         So faint and tenderly, the fang scarce clung <br>
         More than a bird's foot: yet a wound it grew, <br>
         A great one, let this red mark witness you<br>
         Under the left breast; and the stroke thereof <br>
         So clove my sense that I woke out of love <br>
         
         <center>305<br></center>
         And knew not what this dream was nor had wit; <br>
         But now God knows if I have skill of it."<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Hereat she laid one palm against her lips <br>
         To stop their trembling; as when water slips <br>
         Out of a beak-mouthed vessel with faint noise <br>
         And chuckles in the narrowed throat and cloys <br>
         The carven rims with murmuring, so came <br>
         Words in her lips with no word right of them, <br>
         A beaten speech thick and disconsolate, <br>
         Till his smile ceasing waxed compassionate <br>
         Of her sore fear that grew from anything— <br>
         The sound of the strong summer thickening <br>
         In heated leaves of the smooth apple-trees: <br>
         The day's breath felt about the ash-branches, <br>
         And noises of the noon whose weight still grew <br>
         On the hot heavy-headed flowers, and drew <br>
         Their red mouths open till the rose-heart ached; <br>
         For eastward all the crowding rose was slaked <br>
         And soothed with shade; but westward all its growth <br>
         Seemed to breathe hard with heat as a man doth <br>
         Who feels his temples newly feverous. <br>
         And even with such motion in her brows <br>
         As that man hath in whom sick days begin, <br>
         She turned her throat and spake, her voice being thin <br>
         As a sick man's, sudden and tremulous; <br>
         "Sweet, if this end be come indeed on us, <br>
         Let us love more;" and held his mouth with hers. <br>
         As the first sound of flooded hill-waters <br>
         
         <center>306<br></center>
         Is heard by people of the meadow-grass, <br>
         Or ever a wandering waif of ruin pass <br>
         With whirling stones and foam of the brown stream <br>
         Flaked with fierce yellow: so beholding him<br>
         She felt before tears came her eyelids wet, <br>
         Saw the face deadly thin where life was yet, <br>
         Heard his throat's harsh last moan before it clomb: <br>
         And he, with close mouth passionate and dumb, <br>
         Burned at her lips: so lay they without speech, <br>
         Each grasping other, and the eyes of each <br>
         Fed in the other's face: till suddenly <br>
         He cried out with a little broken cry <br>
         This word, "O help me, sweet, I am but dead." <br>
         And even so saying, the colour of fair red <br>
         Was gone out of his face, and his blood's beat <br>
         Fell, and stark death made sharp his upward feet <br>
         And pointed hands: and without moan he died. <br>
         Pain smote her sudden in the brows and side, <br>
         Strained her lips open and made burn her eyes: <br>
         For the pure sharpness of her miseries <br>
         She had no heart's pain, but mere body's wrack; <br>
         But at the last her beaten blood drew back <br>
         Slowly upon her face, and her stunned brows <br>
         Suddenly grown aware and piteous <br>
         Gathered themselves, her eyes shone, her hard breath <br>
         Came as though one nigh dead came back from death; <br>
         
         <center>307<br></center>
         Her lips throbbed, and life trembled through her hair.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And in brief while she thought to bury there <br>
         The dead man that her love might lie with him <br>
         In a sweet bed under the rose-roots dim <br>
         And soft earth round the branchèd apple-trees, <br>
         Full of hushed heat and heavy with great ease, <br>
         And no man entering divide him thence. <br>
         Wherefore she bade one of her handmaidens <br>
         To be her help to do upon this wise. <br>
         And saying so the tears out of her eyes <br>
         Fell without noise and comforted her heart: <br>
         Yea, her great pain eased of the sorest part<br>
         Began to soften in her sense of it. <br>
         There under all the little branches sweet <br>
         The place was shapen of his burial; <br>
         They shed thereon no thing funereal, <br>
         But coloured leaves of latter rose-blossom, <br>
         Stems of soft grass, some withered red and some <br>
         Fair and fresh-blooded; and spoil splendider <br>
         Of marigold and great spent sunflower.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And afterward she came back without word <br>
         To her own house; two days went, and the third <br>
         Went, and she showed her father of this thing. <br>
         And for great grief of her soul's travailing <br>
         He gave consent she should endure in peace <br>
         Till her life's end; yea, till her time should cease, <br>
         She should abide in fellowship of pain. <br>
         And having lived a holy year or twain <br>
         
         <center>308<br></center>
         She died of pure waste heart and weariness. <br>
         And for love's honour in her love's distress <br>
         This word was written over her tomb's head; <br>
         "Here dead she lieth, for whose sake Love is dead."<br>

         <h3>AHOLIBAH.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">In </span>the beginning God made thee <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         A woman well to look upon, <br>
         Thy tender body as a tree <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whereon cool wind hath always blown <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Till the clean branches be well grown.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         There was none like thee in the land; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The girls that were thy bondwomen <br>
         Did bind thee with a purple band <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Upon thy forehead, that all men <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Should know thee for God's handmaiden.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Strange raiment clad thee like a bride, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With silk to wear on hands and feet <br>
         And plates of gold on either side: <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Wine made thee glad, and thou didst eat <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Honey, and choice of pleasant meat.<br>
         
         
         <center>310<br></center>
         <br><br>
         And fishers in the middle sea <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Did get thee sea-fish and sea-weeds <br>
         In colour like the robes on thee; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And curious work of plaited reeds, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And wools wherein live purple bleeds.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         And round the edges of thy cup <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Men wrought thee marvels out of gold, <br>
         Strong snakes with lean throats lifted up, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Large eyes whereon the brows had hold, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And scaly things their slime kept cold.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For thee they blew soft wind in flutes <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And ground sweet roots for cunning scent; <br>
         Made slow because of many lutes, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The wind among thy chambers went <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Wherein no light was violent.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         God called thy name Aholibah, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         His tabernacle being in thee, <br>
         A witness through waste Asia; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thou wert a tent sewn cunningly <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With gold and colours of the sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         God gave thee gracious ministers <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And all their work who plait and weave: <br>
         The cunning of embroiderers <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That sew the pillow to the sleeve, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And likeness of all things that live.<br>
         
         
         <center>311<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Thy garments upon thee were fair <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With scarlet and with yellow thread; <br>
         Also the weaving of thine hair <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Was as fine gold upon thy head, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And thy silk shoes were sewn with red.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All sweet things he bade sift, and ground <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         As a man grindeth wheat in mills <br>
         With strong wheels alway going round; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         He gave thee corn, and grass that fills <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The cattle on a thousand hills.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The wine of many seasons fed <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thy mouth, and made it fair and clean; <br>
         Sweet oil was poured out on thy head <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And ran down like cool rain between <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The strait close locks it melted in.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The strong men and the captains knew <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thy chambers wrought and fashioned <br>
         With gold and covering of blue, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the blue raiment of thine head <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Who satest on a stately bed.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         All these had on their garments wrought <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The shape of beasts and creeping things, <br>
         The body that availeth not, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Flat backs of worms and veinèd wings, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And the lewd bulk that sleeps and stings.<br>
         
         
         <center>312<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Also the chosen of the years, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The multitude being at ease, <br>
         With sackbuts and with dulcimers <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And noise of shawms and psalteries <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Made mirth within the ears of these.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         But as a common woman doth, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thou didst think evil and devise; <br>
         The sweet smell of thy breast and mouth <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thou madest as the harlot's wise, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And there was painting on thine eyes.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Yea, in the woven guest-chamber <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And by the painted passages <br>
         Where the strange gracious paintings were, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         State upon state of companies, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         There came on thee the lust of these.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Because of shapes on either wall <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Sea-coloured from some rare blue shell <br>
         At many a Tyrian interval, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Horsemen on horses, girdled well, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Delicate and desirable,<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Thou saidest: I am sick of love: <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Stay me with flagons, comfort me <br>
         With apples for my pain thereof <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Till my hands gather in his tree <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         That fruit wherein my lips would be.<br>
         
         
         <center>313<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Yea, saidest thou, I will go up <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         When there is no more shade than one <br>
         May cover with a hollow cup, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And make my bed against the sun <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Till my blood's violence be done.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Thy mouth was leant upon the wall <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Against the painted mouth, thy chin <br>
         Touched the hair's painted curve and fall; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thy deep throat, fallen lax and thin, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Worked as the blood's beat worked therein.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Therefore, O thou Aholibah, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         God is not glad because of thee; <br>
         And thy fine gold shall pass away <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Like those fair coins of ore that be <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Washed over by the middle sea.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then will one make thy body bare <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To strip it of all gracious things, <br>
         And pluck the cover from thine hair, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And break the gift of many kings, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Thy wrist-rings and thine ankle-rings.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Likewise the man whose body joins <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To thy smooth body, as was said, <br>
         Who hath a girdle on his loins <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And dyed attire upon his head— <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The same who, seeing, worshipped,<br>
         
         
         <center>314<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Because thy face was like the face <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Of a clean maiden that smells sweet, <br>
         Because thy gait was as the pace <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Of one that opens not her feet <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And is not heard within the street— <br>
         
         <br><br>
         Even he, O thou Aholibah, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Made separate from thy desire, <br>
         Shall cut thy nose and ears away <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And bruise thee for thy body's hire <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And burn the residue with fire.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Then shall the heathen people say, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The multitude being at ease; <br>
         Lo, this is that Aholibah <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Whose name was blown among strange seas, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Grown old with soft adulteries.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Also her bed was made of green, <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Her windows beautiful for glass <br>
         That she had made her bed between: <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Yea, for pure lust her body was <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Made like white summer-coloured grass.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Her raiment was a strong man's spoil; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Upon a table by a bed <br>
         She set mine incense and mine oil <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         To be the beauty of her head <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         In chambers walled about with red.<br>
         
         
         <center>315<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Also between the walls she had <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Fair faces of strong men portrayed; <br>
         All girded round the loins, and clad <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         With several cloths of woven braid <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And garments marvellously made.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Therefore the wrath of God shall be <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Set as a watch upon her way; <br>
         And whoso findeth by the sea <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         Blown dust of bones will hardly say <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         If this were that Aholibah. <br>

         <h3>LOVE AND SLEEP.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Lying</span> asleep between the strokes of night <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I saw my love lean over my sad bed, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Pale as the duskiest lily's leaf or head, <br>
         Smooth-skinned and dark, with bare throat made to bite, <br>
         Too wan for blushing and too warm for white, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         But perfect-coloured without white or red. <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And her lips opened amorously, and said— <br>
         I wist not what, saving one word—Delight. <br>
         And all her face was honey to my mouth, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And all her body pasture to mine eyes; <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         The long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire, <br>
         The quivering flanks, hair smelling of the south, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The bright light feet, the splendid supple thighs <br>
         
         &nbsp; &nbsp;
         And glittering eyelids of my soul's desire. <br>

         <h3>MADONNA MIA.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Under</span> green apple-boughs <br>
         That never a storm will rouse, <br>
         My lady hath her house <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Between two bowers; <br>
         In either of the twain <br>
         Red roses full of rain; <br>
         She hath for bondwomen <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         All kind of flowers.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She hath no handmaid fair <br>
         To draw her curled gold hair <br>
         Through rings of gold that bear <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her whole hair's weight; <br>
         She hath no maids to stand <br>
         Gold-clothed on either hand; <br>
         In all the great green land <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         None is so great.<br>
         
         
         <center>318<br></center>
         <br><br>
         She hath no more to wear <br>
         But one white hood of vair <br>
         Drawn over eyes and hair, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wrought with strange gold, <br>
         Made for some great queen's head, <br>
         Some fair great queen since dead; <br>
         And one strait gown of red <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Against the cold.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Beneath her eyelids deep <br>
         Love lying seems asleep, <br>
         Love, swift to wake, to weep, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To laugh, to gaze; <br>
         Her breasts are like white birds, <br>
         And all her gracious words <br>
         As water-grass to herds <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In the June-days.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         To her all dews that fall <br>
         And rains are musical; <br>
         Her flowers are fed from all, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Her joy from these; <br>
         In the deep-feathered firs <br>
         Their gift of joy is hers, <br>
         In the least breath that stirs <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Across the trees.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         She grows with greenest leaves, <br>
         Ripens with reddest sheaves, <br>
         
         <center>319<br></center>
         Forgets, remembers, grieves, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And is not sad; <br>
         The quiet lands and skies <br>
         Leave light upon her eyes; <br>
         None knows her, weak or wise, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or tired or glad.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         None knows, none understands, <br>
         What flowers are like her hands; <br>
         Though you should search all lands <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wherein time grows, <br>
         What snows are like her feet, <br>
         Though his eyes burn with heat <br>
         Through gazing on my sweet, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Yet no man knows.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Only this thing is said; <br>
         That white and gold and red, <br>
         God's three chief words, man's bread <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And oil and wine, <br>
         Were given her for dowers, <br>
         And kingdom of all hours, <br>
         And grace of goodly flowers <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And various vine.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         This is my lady's praise: <br>
         God after many days <br>
         Wrought her in unknown ways, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In sunset lands; <br>
         
         <center>320<br></center>
         This was my lady's birth; <br>
         God gave her might and mirth <br>
         And laid his whole sweet earth <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Between her hands.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Under deep apple-boughs <br>
         My lady hath her house; <br>
         She wears upon her brows <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The flower thereof; <br>
         All saying but what God saith <br>
         To her is as vain breath; <br>
         She is more strong than death, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Being strong as love. <br>

         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">We </span>were ten maidens in the green corn, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Small red leaves in the mill-water: <br>
         Fairer maidens never were born, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Apples of gold for the king's daughter.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We were ten maidens by a well-head, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Small white birds in the mill-water: <br>
         Sweeter maidens never were wed, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Rings of red for the king's daughter.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The first to spin, the second to sing, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Seeds of wheat in the mill-water; <br>
         The third may was a goodly thing, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         White bread and brown for the king's daughter.<br>

         The fourth to sew and the fifth to play, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fair green weed in the mill-water; <br>
         The sixth may was a goodly may, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         White wine and red for the king's daughter.<br>
         
         
         <center>322<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The seventh to woo, the eighth to wed, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fair thin reeds in the mill-water; <br>
         The ninth had gold work on her head, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Honey in the comb for the king's daughter.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The ninth had gold work round her hair, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fallen flowers in the mill-water; <br>
         The tenth may was goodly and fair, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Golden gloves for the king's daughter.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         We were ten maidens in a field green, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Fallen fruit in the mill-water; <br>
         Fairer maidens never have been, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Golden sleeves for the king's daughter.<br>

         By there comes the king's young son, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         A little wind in the mill-water; <br>
         "Out of ten maidens ye'll grant me one," <br>

         A crown of red for the king's daughter.<br>

         "Out of ten mays ye'll give me the best," <br>

         Wind and hail in the mill-water; <br>
         A grass girdle for all the rest, <br>

         A girdle of arms for the king's daughter.<br>

         He's set his heart to the goodliest, <br>

         Snow that snows in the mill-water; <br>
         Nine little kisses for all the rest, <br>

         An hundredfold for the king's daughter.<br>

         <br><br>
         The first curse was in his mouth, <br>
         Made of grave's mould and deadly drouth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The next curse was in his head, <br>
         Made of God's work discomfited.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The next curse was in his hands, <br>
         Made out of two grave-bands.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The next curse was in his feet, <br>
         Made out of a grave-sheet.<br>

         "I had fair coins red and white, <br>

         And no gold binds in my hair, <br>
         Now I fare as the blind fare.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         My live thews were of great strength, <br>
         Now am I waxen a span's length;<br>
         
         <br><br>
         My live sides were full of lust, <br>
         Now are they dried with dust."<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The first board spake and said: <br>
         "Is it best eating flesh or bread?"<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The second answered it: <br>
         "Is wine or honey the more sweet?"<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The third board spake and said: <br>
         "Is red gold worth a girl's gold head?"<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The fourth made answer thus: <br>
         "All these things are as one with us."<br>

         <br><br>
         The boards said to him: <br>

         The dead man answered thus: <br>
         "What good gift shall God give us?"<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The boards answered him anon: <br>

         "O daughter, if ye have done this thing, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         I wot the greater grief is mine; <br>
         This was a bitter child-bearing, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When ye were got by the sides of Tyne.<br>

         That fly full thick by six and nine, <br>
         Ye'll have my body out of the house, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         To bury me by the sides of Tyne.<br>

         "Set nine stones by the wall for twain, <br>

         <h3>THE YEAR OF LOVE.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">There </span>were four loves that one by one, <br>
         Following the seasons and the sun, <br>
         Passed over without tears, and fell <br>
         Away without farewell.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The first was made of gold and tears, <br>
         The next of aspen-leaves and fears, <br>
         The third of rose-boughs and rose-roots, <br>
         The last love of strange fruits.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         These were the four loves faded. Hold <br>
         Some minutes fast the time of gold <br>
         When our lips each way clung and clove <br>
         To a face full of love.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The tears inside our eyelids met, <br>
         Wrung forth with kissing, and wept wet <br>
         The faces cleaving each to each <br>
         Where the blood served for speech.<br>
         
         
         <center>338<br></center>
         <br><br>
         The second, with low patient brows <br>
         Bound under aspen-coloured boughs <br>
         And eyes made strong and grave with sleep <br>
         And yet too weak to weep— <br>
         
         <br><br>
         The third, with eager mouth at ease <br>
         Fed from late autumn honey, lees <br>
         Of scarce gold left in latter cells <br>
         With scattered flower-smells— <br>
         
         <br><br>
         Hair sprinkled over with spoilt sweet <br>
         Of ruined roses, wrists and feet <br>
         Slight-swathed, as grassy-girdled sheaves <br>
         Hold in stray poppy-leaves— <br>
         
         <br><br>
         The fourth, with lips whereon has bled <br>
         Some great pale fruit's slow colour, shed <br>
         From the rank bitten husk whence drips <br>
         Faint blood between her lips— <br>
         
         <br><br>
         Made of the heat of whole great Junes <br>
         Burning the blue dark round their moons <br>
         (Each like a mown red marigold) <br>
         So hard the flame keeps hold— <br>
         
         <br><br>
         These are burnt thoroughly away. <br>
         Only the first holds out a day <br>
         Beyond these latter loves that were <br>
         Made of mere heat and air.<br>
         
         
         <center>339<br></center>
         <br><br>
         And now the time is winterly <br>
         The first love fades too: none will see, <br>
         When April warms the world anew, <br>
         The place wherein love grew. <br>

         <h3>DEDICATION.</h3>
         
         <h3>1865.</h3>
         <br><br>
         
         <span style="text-transform: uppercase">The </span>sea gives her shells to the shingle, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The earth gives her streams to the sea; <br>
         They are many, but my gift is single, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         My verses, the firstfruits of me. <br>
         Let the wind take the green and the grey leaf, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Cast forth without fruit upon air; <br>
         Take rose-leaf and vine-leaf and bay-leaf <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Blown loose from the hair.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The night shakes them round me in legions, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Dawn drives them before her like dreams; <br>
         Time sheds them like snows on strange regions, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Swept shoreward on infinite streams; <br>
         Leaves pallid and sombre and ruddy, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Dead fruits of the fugitive years; <br>
         Some stained as with wine and made bloody, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And some as with tears.<br>
         
         <center>341<br></center>
         <br><br>
         Some scattered in seven years' traces, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As they fell from the boy that was then; <br>
         Long left among idle green places, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or gathered but now among men;<br>
         On seas full of wonder and peril, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Blown white round the capes of the north; <br>
         Or in islands where myrtles are sterile <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And loves bring not forth.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         O daughters of dreams and of stories <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That life is not wearied of yet, <br>
         Faustine, Fragoletta, Dolores, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Félise and Yolande and Juliette, <br>
         Shall I find you not still, shall I miss you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When sleep, that is true or that seems, <br>
         Comes back to me hopeless to kiss you, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         O daughters of dreams?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         They are past as a slumber that passes, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         As the dew of a dawn of old time; <br>
         More frail than the shadows on glasses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         More fleet than a wave or a rhyme. <br>
         As the waves after ebb drawing seaward, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When their hollows are full of the night, <br>
         So the birds that flew singing to me-ward <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Recede out of sight.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         The songs of dead seasons, that wander <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         On wings of articulate words; <br>
         
         <center>342<br></center>
         Lost leaves that the shore-wind may squander, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Light flocks of untameable birds; <br>
         Some sang to me dreaming in class-time <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And truant in hand as in tongue; <br>
         For the youngest were born of boy's pastime, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The eldest are young.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Is there shelter while life in them lingers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is there hearing for songs that recede,<br>
         Tunes touched from a harp with man's fingers <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Or blown with boy's mouth in a reed? <br>
         Is there place in the land of your labour, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Is there room in your world of delight, <br>
         Where change has not sorrow for neighbour <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And day has not night?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In their wings though the sea-wind yet quivers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Will you spare not a space for them there <br>
         Made green with the running of rivers <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And gracious with temperate air; <br>
         In the fields and the turreted cities, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That cover from sunshine and rain <br>
         Fair passions and bountiful pities <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And loves without stain?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         In a land of clear colours and stories, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         In a region of shadowless hours, <br>
         Where earth has a garment of glories <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And a murmur of musical flowers; <br>
         
         <center>343<br></center>
         In woods where the spring half uncovers <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The flush of her amorous face, <br>
         By the waters that listen for lovers, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For these is there place?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         For the song-birds of sorrow, that muffle <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Their music as clouds do their fire: <br>
         For the storm-birds of passion, that ruffle <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Wild wings in a wind of desire; <br>
         In the stream of the storm as it settles <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Blown seaward, borne far from the sun, <br>
         Shaken loose on the darkness like petals <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Dropt one after one?<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Though the world of your hands be more gracious <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And lovelier in lordship of things <br>
         Clothed round by sweet art with the spacious <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Warm heaven of her imminent wings, <br>
         Let them enter, unfledged and nigh fainting, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         For the love of old loves and lost times; <br>
         And receive in your palace of painting <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         This revel of rhymes.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Though the seasons of man full of losses <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Make empty the years full of youth, <br>
         If but one thing be constant in crosses, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Change lays not her hand upon truth; <br>
         Hopes die, and their tombs are for token <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         That the grief as the joy of them ends <br>
         
         <center>344<br></center>
         Ere time that breaks all men has broken <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         The faith between friends.<br>
         
         <br><br>
         Though the many lights dwindle to one light, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         There is help if the heaven has one; <br>
         Though the skies be discrowned of the sunlight <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         And the earth dispossessed of the sun, <br>
         They have moonlight and sleep for repayment, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         When, refreshed as a bride and set free, <br>
         With stars and sea-winds in her raiment, <br>
         
         &nbsp;
         Night sinks on the sea. <br>
