	cache dir
	rake tasks
	etc.

Implement richer navigation model
	each node should know about its parent
		parse json into composite object?
	remove first_child code?
		allow id to not be present in arg list, opts default to last if hash
		instead, if nav node doesn't have id, get first child's id etc.?
		-- handle this logic in view helper?

Allow blank variant_id (copy of a book, for example), navigation id's are getting "swinburne--poems" instead of "sunwburne-poems"
	This is a bug in NavBuilder (check for empty values before joining or compact the array)

Solidify generic Solr schema -- don't use dynamic fields?

Break-up Raven module into standard Ruby gem directory structure

Various export formats for document details view
	juxta, pdf, text-only etc.

Bring back JS text diff plugin
